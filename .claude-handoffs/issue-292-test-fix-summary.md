# Issue 292 Test Fix Summary

## Issue
The test "navigates to world detail page after creation" was initially failing according to the handoff document.

## Investigation
I investigated the failing test by running specific test files to identify the issue. When running the tests individually and then as a full suite, all tests were found to be passing.

## Current Status
- All WorldCreationWizard tests are passing
- The specific test mentioned in the handoff ("navigates to world detail page after creation") is now passing
- All other tests in the codebase are passing

## Test Files Checked
1. `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/__tests__/worldCreationWizard.navigation.test.tsx` - PASSED
2. `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/__tests__/worldCreationWizard.fullFlow.test.tsx` - PASSED
3. `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/__tests__/worldCreationWizard.persistence.test.tsx` - PASSED
4. `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/__tests__/worldCreationWizard.existingList.test.tsx` - PASSED
5. All WorldCreationWizard tests - PASSED
6. Full test suite - PASSED

## Conclusion
The test mentioned in the handoff document is no longer failing. All tests are passing successfully. No code changes were needed as the issue was already resolved.
