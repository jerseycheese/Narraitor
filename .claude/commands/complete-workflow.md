I'll guide you through a complete workflow for implementing issue #$ARGUMENTS, from analysis to PR creation.

Let's start the workflow:

## STEP 1: ANALYZE ISSUE

I'll analyze GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS using @modelcontextprotocol/server-github to get a clear understanding of the requirements and create a technical spec.

First, I'll fetch the issue details using the MCP GitHub tool:

[After this I'll output the complete issue details and my analysis below]

# Technical Specification for Issue #$ARGUMENTS

## REVIEW POINT 1:
Are you satisfied with this analysis? Type "continue" to proceed with TDD implementation or provide feedback to adjust the analysis.

## STEP 2: TDD IMPLEMENTATION

I'll now implement the feature using Test-Driven Development:
1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Verify tests fail (red)
3. Implement code to make tests pass (green)
4. Refactor while keeping tests passing

[I'll output the complete implementation details below]

## REVIEW POINT 2:
Are you satisfied with the implementation? Type "continue" to proceed with documentation or provide feedback to improve the implementation.

## STEP 3: CREATE DOCUMENTATION

I'll now create documentation for the implemented feature:

[I'll output the complete documentation below]

## REVIEW POINT 3:
Is the documentation complete and accurate? Type "continue" to proceed with creating a PR or provide feedback to enhance the documentation.

## STEP 4: CREATE PULL REQUEST

I'll prepare and submit a pull request for your changes:

[I'll output the complete PR details below]

## WORKFLOW COMPLETE

The feature implementation workflow is now complete! The PR has been created and is ready for review.
