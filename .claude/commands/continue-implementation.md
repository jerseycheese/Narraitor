Please continue implementing the remaining tasks for issue #$ARGUMENTS:

1. First, implement the timestamp formatting utility:
```bash
# Create a utility function to format timestamps consistently
mkdir -p src/utils/formatting
touch src/utils/formatting/dateUtils.ts
```

2. Then, add responsive styles for different screen sizes
3. Update/create comprehensive Storybook stories
4. Test accessibility standards compliance

For the timestamp formatting utility, you should:
- Create a reusable function for formatting dates consistently
- Support both relative (e.g., "2 days ago") and absolute (e.g., "May 17, 2025") formats
- Handle edge cases like null/undefined dates
- Include appropriate unit tests

After completing these remaining tasks, proceed with the PR creation step.

Remember to check off each completed task as you go.
