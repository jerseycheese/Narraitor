I'll help you transition from Claude App to Claude Code or vice versa with context for $ARGUMENTS.

## App to Code Transition

If you've been working with Claude App and want to continue in Claude Code:

1. I'll create a context summary of what we've discussed
2. I'll identify the key files and components involved
3. I'll prepare a Claude Code command that includes the relevant context
4. I'll provide the command for you to run in your terminal

## Code to App Transition

If you've been working with Claude Code and want to continue in Claude App:

1. I'll summarize what we've accomplished in Claude Code
2. I'll identify any challenges or issues we encountered
3. I'll prepare a context summary to paste into Claude App
4. I'll create a prompt that best continues our work

Let me prepare the appropriate transition for $ARGUMENTS:
