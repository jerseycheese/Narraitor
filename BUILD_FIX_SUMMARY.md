# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Character Type Mismatch**
   - The `Character` interface extends `NamedEntity` which includes a `description` field
   - Added missing `description` field to character creation in PortraitStep and PortraitDebugSection
   - Fixed character.background.description access to use character.description directly

2. **Duplicate Type Definitions**
   - Found conflicting Character interfaces in `characterStore.ts` vs `character.types.ts`
   - The store uses a simplified version with different property names (e.g., `hp` vs `health`)
   - Created helper functions to handle the type mismatches between store and types

3. **ESLint Warnings**
   - Replaced `any` types with more specific types where possible
   - Added ESLint disable comments where `any` was necessary due to complex type conflicts
   - Fixed unused type definitions

4. **Mock Client Constructor**
   - Fixed MockGeminiImageClient instantiation to not pass config argument

## Architectural Issues Identified

The main issue is that `characterStore.ts` defines its own Character interface that differs from the one in `character.types.ts`. This causes type conflicts throughout the application. A future refactor should:

1. Unify the Character type definitions
2. Update the store to use the types from character.types.ts
3. Create proper type converters if different shapes are needed for storage vs runtime
