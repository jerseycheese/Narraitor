# Portrait Generation Fix Summary

## Issue
When generating a portrait for "Bob Wiley" (Bill Murray's character from "What About Bob?"), the system was generating a good prompt but the actual image appeared to be just a generic Bill Murray photo instead of following the prompt to show him in character.

## Root Cause
The portrait generator was creating prompts like "Bill Murray as Bob Wiley" which the Gemini image generation API was interpreting as just generating an image of Bill Murray rather than Bill Murray portraying the specific character.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Generation for Fictional Characters
Modified the `buildPortraitPrompt` method in `portraitGenerator.ts` to be more explicit when dealing with fictional characters played by known actors:

**Before:**
```typescript
parts.push(`${options.actorName} as ${character.name}`);
```

**After:**
```typescript
parts.push(`${options.actorName} portraying the character ${character.name}`);
// Additional context added:
- "with appearance matching: [physical description]"
- "in character"
- "movie still"
- "cinematic lighting"
- "in-character expression and costume"
```

### 2. Improved Known Figure Detection
Enhanced the `detectKnownFigure` method to include an example in the prompt to help the AI better understand the task:

```typescript
For example: "Bob Wiley" is a fictional character played by Bill Murray in "What About Bob?"
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the portrait generation pipeline:
- Detection results logging
- Generated prompt logging
- API request/response logging

To enable debug logging, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGGING=true` in your `.env.local` file.

## Testing the Fix

1. Enable debug logging in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGGING=true
   ```

2. Navigate to the portrait test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dev/portrait-prompt-test
   ```

3. Use the "Bob Wiley" preset or enter the character details manually

4. Click "Generate Portrait" and check the browser console for:
   - Detection results (should show Bill Murray as the actor)
   - Generated prompt (should include "portraying the character" language)
   - API response structure

## Expected Behavior

The new prompt format should generate images that show:
- Bill Murray in character as Bob Wiley
- Matching the physical description (messy hair, anxious expression, casual vacation clothes)
- Movie still quality with cinematic lighting
- Clear indication this is the character, not just the actor

## Additional Improvements

The fix also improves portrait generation for other fictional characters:
- Better handling of characters from movies/TV shows
- More specific prompts that emphasize the character portrayal
- Inclusion of physical descriptions to guide the image generation
- Appropriate styling (movie still vs professional headshot)

## Next Steps

If the issue persists:
1. Check if the Gemini API has specific limitations on generating images of known people
2. Consider alternative prompt strategies (e.g., focusing more on the character description without mentioning the actor)
3. Implement a fallback mechanism for cases where the API refuses to generate certain images
