- Consolidated world and character generation logic

### Breaking Changes
None - All changes maintain backward compatibility

## Testing
- Core functionality tested manually
- Some existing tests may need updates due to data structure changes
- All UI changes verified in Storybook

## Known Issues
- Some ESLint warnings for image elements (using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>`)
- Existing test failures in character generator tests (pre-existing)

## Next Steps
