# Architecture Decisions

This document records the key architectural decisions made for the NarrAItor project.

## 1. Next.js App Router

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14+ with App Router for the frontend framework.

**Context**: The project requires a modern, maintainable frontend with server and client components.

**Consequences**:
- Better support for nested layouts (important for the game interface)
- Improved data loading and state management
- Better performance through server components
- More flexible routing patterns for dynamic game sessions

## 2. Domain-Driven Design

**Decision**: Organize code by business domains rather than technical concerns.

**Context**: The application has clearly defined domain boundaries.

**Consequences**:
- Keeps related functionality together
- Aligns code structure with business domains
- Makes it easier to understand responsibilities
- Supports future modularity if needed

## 3. State Management with Context API

**Decision**: Use React Context API with useReducer pattern for state management.

**Context**: The application requires manageable state across multiple domains.

**Consequences**:
- Simpler than Redux for a single-developer project
- Follows React's built-in patterns
- Domain-specific contexts limit complexity
- Easier to test and maintain

## 4. IndexedDB for Persistence

**Decision**: Use IndexedDB for client-side data persistence.

**Context**: The application needs to store complex data structures locally.

**Consequences**:
- Better performance than localStorage for complex data
- Supports offline functionality
- No server requirements for MVP
- Scalable storage capacity

## 5. Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for component styling.

**Context**: The application requires a maintainable styling approach with theme support.

**Consequences**:
- Utility-first approach reduces CSS complexity
- Easy theming for different world types
- Consistent design system
- Good performance characteristics

## 6. Component-First Development

**Decision**: Use a Storybook-first approach for UI component development.

**Context**: The application has many UI components that should be developed in isolation.

**Consequences**:
- Better component isolation during development
- Improved testing of component states
- Self-documenting component API
- Parallel development of UI and logic

## 7. Test-Driven Development

**Decision**: Follow a TDD approach with Jest and React Testing Library.

**Context**: The application requires high reliability and maintainability.

**Consequences**:
- Better code quality
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Regression prevention
- Documentation of expected behavior

## 8. Single Player Focus

**Decision**: Design as a single-player experience for MVP.

**Context**: Simplifying scope for initial implementation.

**Consequences**:
- Reduced complexity in state management
- No need for real-time synchronization
- Simpler authentication requirements
- Focus on core narrative experience

## 9. File Size Limits

**Decision**: Implement a strict 300-line limit per file.

**Context**: Maintaining clean, focused code modules.

**Consequences**:
- Improved readability
- Forces proper separation of concerns
- Better testability
- Easier maintenance and review

## 10. AI Integration Abstraction

**Decision**: Create an abstraction layer for AI integration to support multiple providers.

**Context**: Flexibility in AI model selection is important for future development.

**Consequences**:
- Easier to switch between AI providers
- Consistent interface for narrative generation
- Simplified testing with mocks
- Ability to implement fallbacks
