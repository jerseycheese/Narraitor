# Technical Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the technical approach and technology stack for the Narraitor project. It focuses on modern best practices, maintainable code, and a tech stack that supports the project's unique requirements.

## Core Technologies

- Server and client components for optimal rendering
- Built-in routing with nested layouts
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Efficient client-side navigation
- Modern image optimization

### Language: TypeScript

TypeScript provides:
- Static type checking for improved reliability
- Better developer experience with IDE integration
- Self-documenting code through types
- Easier refactoring and maintenance
- Improved team collaboration

Tailwind CSS provides:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Easy theme customization for different worlds
- Small bundle size with purging
- No need to maintain separate CSS files

### State Management: React Context with useReducer

This approach provides:
- Domain-specific state management
- Simplified state updates through reducers

- Built-in React patterns without external libraries
- Easier testing through pure reducer functions

### Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright

This testing stack provides:
- Unit testing for functions and hooks
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Support for Test-Driven Development
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Data Persistence: IndexedDB

IndexedDB provides:
- Client-side storage for larger datasets
- Structured data with indexes for efficient queries
- Transaction support for data integrity
- Offline capabilities
- Async API for better performance

### Component Development: Storybook

Storybook provides:
- Isolated component development environment
- Visual testing of component states
- Interactive documentation
- Component showcase for stakeholders
- Accessibility testing

### AI Integration: Google Gemini (Primary)

Google Gemini provides:
- Powerful language understanding
- Creative text generation
- Context management capabilities
- Multi-modal capabilities for future enhancements
- Reasonable pricing model

## Development Practices

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Implementation follows a strict TDD approach:
1. Write tests to define expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor for clarity and maintainability
4. Repeat for each feature
5. Create flow diagrams before implementation
6. Maintain high test coverage for critical paths

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

The codebase follows KISS principles:
1. Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
2. Avoid premature optimization
3. Maintain readability over cleverness
4. Break complex problems into simple parts
5. Use standard patterns where possible
6. Focus on core functionality first
7. Implement only what's necessary for the current iteration

### Component-First Development

UI development follows a component-first approach:
1. Define component API with props interface
2. Create Storybook stories for variants
3. Implement component in isolation
4. Write component tests
5. Integrate into application

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Code organization follows DDD principles:
1. Organize by business domains
2. Create well-defined boundaries between domains
3. Domain-specific models and logic
4. Shared kernel for cross-cutting concerns

### Clean Code Principles

Code quality is maintained through:
1. Consistent naming conventions
2. Small, focused functions (<25 lines)
3. Small, focused components (<300 lines)
4. Clear separation of concerns
5. Consistent formatting with Prettier
6. Linting with ESLint

## Code Organization and Structure

### File Size Limits
- **Component files**: Maximum 300 lines
- **Utility files**: Maximum 200 lines
- **Hook files**: Maximum 150 lines
- **Type definition files**: Maximum 200 lines

### Domain-Based Organization
- Group related files by business domain rather than technical type
- Keep related functionality together (types, components, hooks, utilities)
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Use domain-driven design principles consistently

### Separation of Concerns
- Each file should have a single, clear responsibility
- Split complex components into smaller, focused ones
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Move utility functions to dedicated files
- Maintain clear boundaries between domains

### Module Dependencies
- Strive for unidirectional dependencies between modules
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Create clear abstractions for external services
- Document integration points between systems

## Folder Structure Rationale

The project uses a domain-driven folder structure:

```
src/
├── app/                     # Next.js App Router
├── domains/                 # Domain-specific logic
│   ├── world/
│   ├── character/
│   ├── narrative/
│   ├── journal/
│   └── ai/
├── components/              # Shared UI components
├── lib/                     # Shared utilities
├── state/                   # Global state management
├── types/                   # Shared type definitions
└── templates/               # World templates
```

This structure provides:
1. Clear organization by business domains
2. Separation of UI from business logic
3. Reusable components across domains
4. Centralized types for consistency
5. Shared utilities for common functionality

## Performance Considerations

### State Management Optimization
- Use memoization (useMemo, useCallback) for expensive calculations
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect and memo hooks
- Split global state into domain-specific contexts to minimize re-renders
- Leverage React.memo for pure components that render often
- Consider state compression for efficient storage
- Implement batch processing for journal entries

### UI Performance
- Implement virtualization for large lists (react-window)
- Optimize image loading and display
- Use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations when possible
- Defer non-critical rendering with suspense and lazy loading
- Apply memoization for complex UI elements
- Use virtualized components for large data sets
- Implement lazy loading for historical content

### Data Handling
- Batch updates to minimize render cycles
- Use efficient data structures for lookups (Maps, Sets)
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Cache results of expensive operations
- Optimize IndexedDB operations for local persistence
- Implement efficient context window management for AI prompts

### Application Responsiveness
- Keep main thread clear with web workers for intensive operations
- Break up long-running tasks into smaller chunks
- Set up request priorities for network operations
- Implement loading indicators and optimistic UI updates

## Security Considerations

Even as a client-side application, security is maintained through:
1. Content sanitization for user-generated content
2. API key security for AI service integration
3. Input validation for all user inputs
4. Content filtering for AI-generated content

## Accessibility Considerations

The application prioritizes accessibility through:
1. Semantic HTML
2. ARIA attributes where needed
3. Keyboard navigation support
4. Color contrast requirements
5. Focus management
6. Screenreader-friendly content

## Future Scalability

The architecture supports future growth through:
1. Domain-driven design for easier extensions
2. Abstracted AI service for provider switching
3. Feature flag support for gradual rollout
4. Clear component boundaries for reuse
5. Well-typed interfaces for consistency

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a phased approach:
1. Core infrastructure and shared utilities
2. World configuration domain
3. Character system domain
4. Narrative engine domain
5. Journal system domain
6. Integration and cross-cutting features
