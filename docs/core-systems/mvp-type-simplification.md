# MVP Type Simplification Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to simplify the type system for MVP scope.

## Changes Made

### 1. Inventory System - RESTORED to MVP
- Initially removed but restored after clarification
- Kept simplified version with only essential properties
- Added to Phase 1.6 in roadmap

### 2. Simplified InventoryItem
**Removed Properties:**
- `weight` - Advanced encumbrance system (Post-MVP)
- `value` - Economy/trading system (Post-MVP)
- `equipped` - Equipment system (Post-MVP)
- `properties` - Complex item effects (Post-MVP)

**Kept Properties:**
- `id`, `name`, `description` (from NamedEntity)
- `categoryId` - Basic organization
- `quantity` - Essential for stacking

### 3. Simplified CharacterAttribute
**Removed:**
- `modifiers` array - Complex modifier system (Post-MVP)
- `AttributeModifier` interface - Not needed for MVP

**Kept:**
- `attributeId` - Reference to world attribute
- `value` - Current attribute value

### 4. Simplified WorldSettings
**Removed:**
- `tone` - Advanced tone customization (Post-MVP)

**Kept:**
- Core character creation constraints
- Attribute and skill limits

### 5. Simplified NarrativeMetadata  
**Removed:**

### 6. Character Changes

**Kept:**
- All core character data including inventory

## Implementation Notes

- All type guards updated to match simplified types
- All tests updated to use simplified interfaces
- Documentation reflects MVP scope
- Roadmap updated to move inventory to Phase 1.6 (MVP)

## Type Complexity Reduction

The simplification reduces:
- Number of optional properties
- Complex nested structures
- Advanced feature dependencies
- Overall type complexity

This makes the MVP implementation more focused and achievable while maintaining extensibility for future features.
