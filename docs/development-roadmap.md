# Narraitor Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development phases for the Narraitor project, focusing on an MVP approach with clear milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Core Framework (MVP)

### Current MVP Focus Issues
- **Improve Navigation & User Flow** - Streamline world → character → game flow
- **Narrative Ending System** - Implement graceful story conclusions with AI epilogues

### 1.1 Environment Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig
- [x] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [x] Configure Storybook for component development
- [x] Create initial project structure

### 1.2 Core Types and Interfaces ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Define simplified world configuration interfaces
- [x] Create basic character system types
- [x] Establish minimal narrative engine interfaces
- [x] Design essential journal system types
- [x] Define state persistence interfaces

### 1.3 State Management Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement core state management architecture (Using Zustand)
- [x] Create domain-specific stores (World, Character, Inventory, Narrative, Journal, Session, AI Context)
- [x] Initialize stores with default MVP values
- [x] Add basic state persistence configuration for IndexedDB
- [x] Implement unit tests for store initialization

**Implementation Notes:**
- Implemented MVP-level Zustand stores with basic state initialization only
- Each domain has its own store with typed initial state
- Persistence configuration created for future IndexedDB integration
- Tests verify store initialization (TDD approach used)
- No complex actions or cross-domain interactions included (as per MVP scope)

### 1.4 World Configuration System ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement world configuration reducer (via Zustand store)
- [x] Create minimal world creation UI components (6-step wizard)
- [x] Build freeform world description analyzer using AI
- [x] Implement attribute and skill suggestion system
- [x] Create user interface for reviewing and editing AI suggestions
- [x] Develop basic world template system as fallback option
- [x] Add basic validation for world configurations
- [x] Create test worlds for development (can be generated via AI)
- [x] World editor interface for post-creation editing
- [x] AI-powered world generation with name suggestions

### 1.5 Character System ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement character state reducer
- [x] Create 4-step character creation wizard (Basic Info, Attributes, Skills, Background)
- [x] Develop basic character sheet component
- [x] Add point-buy attribute allocation with world-defined constraints
- [x] Implement skill selection (max 8 skills per character)
- [x] Create test characters for each world

### 1.6 Basic Inventory System
- [ ] Implement inventory state reducer
- [ ] Create simple item management
- [ ] Develop inventory UI component
- [ ] Add item categorization
- [ ] Create basic item interaction

### 1.7 Narrative Engine ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Set up Google Gemini AI integration
- [x] Create prompt template system
- [x] Implement context management (preserving 5-10 narrative segments)
- [x] Develop player choice system with 3-4 options per decision point
- [x] **ENHANCED: Custom Player Input System** - Players can type custom actions in addition to selecting from AI-generated choices
- [x] Add scene transition handling
- [x] Create error recovery mechanisms with retries and fallback content

**Implementation Notes:**
- Complete AI-powered narrative generation using Google Gemini
- Advanced choice system with both predefined and custom player input options
- Custom input features: 250-character limit, live validation, accessibility support
- Narrative integration ensures custom actions are incorporated into story progression
- Delayed choice regeneration after custom input to prevent data conflicts

### 1.8 Journal System

- [ ] Develop simple journal viewer component
- [ ] Add entry categorization (4 primary types, major/minor significance)
- [ ] Implement new/unread entry indicators and session date grouping
- [ ] Add filtering by entry type and significance

### 1.9 Basic UI Components
- [ ] Create navigation structure (**Issue: Improve Navigation & User Flow**)
- [ ] Implement world selection interface
- [ ] Develop game session UI
- [ ] Add essential form components
- [ ] Create themed container components

### 1.10 Game Session Management
