# Narraitor Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development phases for the Narraitor project, focusing on an MVP approach with clear milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Core Framework (MVP)

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig
- [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Configure Storybook for component development
- [ ] Create initial project structure

### 1.2 Core Types and Interfaces
- [ ] Define simplified world configuration interfaces
- [ ] Create basic character system types
- [ ] Establish minimal narrative engine interfaces
- [ ] Design essential journal system types
- [ ] Define state persistence interfaces

### 1.3 State Management Foundation âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Implement core state management architecture (Using Zustand)
- [x] Create domain-specific stores (World, Character, Inventory, Narrative, Journal, Session, AI Context)
- [x] Initialize stores with default MVP values
- [x] Add basic state persistence configuration for IndexedDB
- [x] Implement unit tests for store initialization

**Implementation Notes:**
- Implemented MVP-level Zustand stores with basic state initialization only
- Each domain has its own store with typed initial state
- Persistence configuration created for future IndexedDB integration
- Tests verify store initialization (TDD approach used)
- No complex actions or cross-domain interactions included (as per MVP scope)

### 1.4 World Configuration System
- [ ] Implement world configuration reducer

- [ ] Implement attribute and skill suggestion system
- [ ] Create user interface for reviewing and editing AI suggestions
- [ ] Develop basic world template system as fallback option
- [ ] Add basic validation for world configurations
- [ ] Create test worlds for development:
  - [ ] Western
  - [ ] Sitcom
  - [ ] Fantasy

### 1.5 Character System
- [ ] Implement character state reducer
- [ ] Create 4-step character creation wizard (Basic Info, Attributes, Skills, Background)
- [ ] Develop basic character sheet component
- [ ] Add point-buy attribute allocation with world-defined constraints
- [ ] Implement skill selection (max 8 skills per character)
- [ ] Create test characters for each world

### 1.6 Basic Inventory System
- [ ] Implement inventory state reducer
- [ ] Create simple item management
- [ ] Develop inventory UI component
- [ ] Add item categorization
- [ ] Create basic item interaction

### 1.7 Narrative Engine
- [ ] Set up Google Gemini AI integration
- [ ] Create prompt template system
- [ ] Implement context management (preserving 5-10 narrative segments)
- [ ] Develop player choice system with 3-4 options per decision point
- [ ] Add scene transition handling
- [ ] Create error recovery mechanisms with retries and fallback content

### 1.8 Journal System
- [ ] Implement basic journal state reducer
- [ ] Create automatic entry generation
- [ ] Develop simple journal viewer component
- [ ] Add entry categorization (4 primary types, major/minor significance)
- [ ] Implement new/unread entry indicators and session date grouping
- [ ] Add filtering by entry type and significance

### 1.9 Basic UI Components
- [ ] Create navigation structure
- [ ] Implement world selection interface
- [ ] Develop game session UI

- [ ] Create NPC generation system
- [ ] Develop NPC interaction components
- [ ] Add relationship tracking
- [ ] Implement NPC memory and consistency

### 2.3 Expanded Journal
- [ ] Add character relationship tracking
- [ ] Implement NPC entry generation
- [ ] Create event categorization
- [ ] Develop timeline visualization
- [ ] Add search functionality

### 2.4 Enhanced UI
