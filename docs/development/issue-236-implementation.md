# Issue #236 Implementation Summary

## Issue: Modify world settings attributes and skills after initial creation

### Objective
Implement a world editing feature that allows users to modify existing worlds, including all settings, attributes, and skills.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Navigation Integration
- Updated `WorldCard` component to navigate to edit page
- Added `handleEditClick` function that routes to `/world/[id]/edit`
- Maintained consistency with existing navigation patterns

### 2. Page Structure
- Created new route: `/src/app/world/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- Handles async params using React's `use()` hook for Next.js 15 compatibility
- Renders `WorldEditor` component with world ID

### 3. WorldEditor Component
Main orchestrator component that:
- Loads world data from `worldStore`
- Manages form state
- Handles save/cancel operations
- Provides error handling for missing worlds
- Shows loading states during data fetch

### 4. Form Components
Created four reusable form components in `/src/components/forms/`:

#### WorldBasicInfoForm
- Edits name, description, and theme
- Simple input fields with controlled components

#### WorldAttributesForm
- Add/Edit/Remove attributes
- Configure name, description, category
- Set min/max/base values
- Dynamic list management

#### WorldSkillsForm
- Add/Edit/Remove skills
- Link skills to attributes
- Set difficulty levels
- Category organization

#### WorldSettingsForm
- Configure world limits
- Set point pools
- Number inputs with validation

### 5. Testing Strategy
- TDD approach with tests written first
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for WorldEditor
- Navigation tests for page routing
- Mock implementations for isolated testing

### 6. Code Organization
- Moved form components to general `/components/forms/` directory
- Updated Storybook organization for better discoverability
- Maintained separation of concerns

## Technical Decisions

### State Management
- Used local component state for form data
- Only persist to store on explicit save
- Implemented optimistic UI updates

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing worlds
- User-friendly error messages
- Return to worlds list option

### Form Validation
- Input type validation (numbers for settings)
- Minimum value constraints
- Required field validation

### Component Architecture
- Small, focused components
- Single responsibility principle
- Reusable form sections

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Selecting a world allows viewing/editing its details via the WorldEditor
✅ The WorldEditor provides forms to modify basic info, attributes, and skills
✅ Changes are saved with an explicit save action
✅ The editor prevents invalid modifications
✅ The editing interface is consistent with the creation interface

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `/src/app/world/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `/src/components/WorldEditor/WorldEditor.tsx`
- `/src/components/forms/WorldBasicInfoForm.tsx`
- `/src/components/forms/WorldAttributesForm.tsx`
- `/src/components/forms/WorldSkillsForm.tsx`
- `/src/components/forms/WorldSettingsForm.tsx`
- All corresponding test and story files

### Modified:
- `/src/components/WorldCard/WorldCard.tsx`
- `/src/components/WorldCard/__tests__/WorldCard.test.tsx`

## Testing Results
- All tests passing (517 total)
- Build successful
- ESLint errors resolved
- Type safety maintained

## Lessons Learned
1. Next.js 15 requires special handling for async params
2. Form components benefit from being in a general location
3. TDD approach caught issues early
4. Comprehensive mocking simplifies testing

## Future Considerations
- Auto-save functionality could improve UX
- Consider adding confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Form validation could be enhanced with more specific rules
- Performance optimization for large worlds with many attributes/skills
