# UI/UX Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the user interface and experience guidelines for NarrAItor. These guidelines ensure a consistent, accessible, and responsive design that adapts to the selected world theme while providing an intuitive user experience.

## Core Principles

### 1. World-Adaptive Design
- UI elements adapt to the selected world theme
- Typography, color schemes, and visual elements reflect the world setting
- Maintain consistent structure while allowing theme-specific styling
- Create immersive visual experiences appropriate to genre

### 2. Responsive Layout
- Application works across all screen sizes
- Mobile-first approach to design
- Optimized for both touch and keyboard/mouse input
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Design elements scale appropriately with screen size

### 3. Accessibility Focus
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- Screen reader compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast
- Focus management
- Alt text for all images
- Proper semantic HTML structure

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- Show only what's needed at each step
- Reveal complexity progressively
- Provide clear navigation paths
- Use accordions, tabs, and expandable sections for complex content
- Guide the user through multi-step processes

## World Theming

### Theme Components
Each world theme includes:
- Primary and secondary colors
- Typography settings (font family, sizes, weights)
- Background textures or colors
- UI element styling (buttons, cards, inputs)
- Specialized iconography

### Theme Implementation
- Theme context provides current theme settings
- Theme-aware components adapt styling based on context
- Tailwind CSS classes dynamically applied
- CSS variables for theme-specific values

### Default Themes
The application includes these template themes:
1. **Western**: Rustic with serif fonts, earthy colors, and aged paper textures
2. **Sitcom**: Modern with clean sans-serif, bright colors, and minimal styling
3. **Adventure**: Fantasy with decorative fonts, rich colors, and ornate styling

## Component Design

### Interactive Elements
- **Buttons**: Clear states (default, hover, active, disabled)
- **Inputs**: Consistent styling with clear focus states
- **Selectors**: Accessible dropdown and radio/checkbox inputs
- **Cards**: Consistent formatting for content containers

### Critical UI Patterns
- **Forms**: Consistent layout with inline validation
- **Navigation**: Clear hierarchy and current location indicators
- **Lists**: Virtualized for performance with large datasets
- **Modals**: Focused, accessible dialog patterns
- **Notifications**: Non-intrusive but visible messaging

## Responsive Breakpoints

```css
/* Small (mobile) */
@media (min-width: 640px) { ... }

/* Medium (tablet) */
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

/* Large (laptop) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }

/* X-Large (desktop) */
@media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }
```

## Accessibility Requirements

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order through the interface
- Skip links for navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and roles where needed
- Meaningful alt text for images
- Live region announcements for dynamic content

### Visual Accessibility
- Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text
- Focus indicators visible in all themes
- No reliance on color alone for information
- Resizable text without breaking layouts

## Game Session Interface

The game session interface follows specific guidelines:

### Narrative Display
- Clear typography with adjustable size
- Proper paragraph spacing for readability
- Distinguished speech vs. description text
- Thematic styling based on world selection
- Text formatting appropriate to narrative content

### Decision Selection
- Clear, distinguishable options
- Equal visual weight to each option (unless intentionally weighted)
- Clear selection and hover states
- Sufficient spacing between options
- Appropriate feedback for user choices

### Character Information
- Access to relevant character details
- Non-intrusive display of important stats
- Collapsible sections for detailed information
- Visual indicators for character state changes
- Information hierarchy reflects importance

## Performance Guidelines

### User Perception Optimizations
- Implement skeleton screens for loading states
- Use fade transitions for smoother content changes
- Prioritize above-the-fold content rendering
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions

### Virtualization
- Virtualize large lists (journal entries, character lists)
- Load images progressively or lazily
- Defer non-critical UI elements
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Apply efficient rendering for long content

### Rendering Optimization
- Use memoized components for complex UI elements
- Implement efficient context window management
- Apply batch processing for list operations
- Implement lazy loading for historical content
- Use performance monitoring during development

## Implementation Approach

### Component Development
1. Create base components in Storybook first
2. Implement theme-aware styling
3. Test accessibility with axe or similar tools
4. Verify responsive behavior
5. Integrate into application

### Theme System
1. Define theme interface and default themes
2. Create theme context provider
3. Implement theme-aware component styling
4. Add theme switching capability
5. Persist theme preferences

## Consistent Design Patterns

### Error States
- Clear visual indication of errors
- Helpful error messages
- Guidance on how to resolve issues
- Consistent error presentation

### Loading States
- Consistent loading indicators
- Appropriate feedback during long operations
- Non-blocking UIs during loading
- Graceful failure handling

### Empty States
- Helpful guidance when lists are empty
- Clear calls to action
- Context-appropriate illustrations or icons
- Informative messaging for users
