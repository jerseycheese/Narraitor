# Test-Driven Development with KISS Principles

> [!important] 
> This workflow emphasizes writing tests first, implementing to meet test expectations, and maintaining a "Keep It Simple, Stupid" approach throughout.

## Core Workflow Loop

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Plan: Define MVP Tests] -->|Write failing tests| B[Implement: Minimal Component]
    B -->|Run Build| C{Build Errors?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Fix Build Errors]
    D --> B
    C -->|No| E{Run Jest Tests}
    E -->|Failing| F[Fix Implementation]
    F --> B
    E -->|Passing| G[Manual Testing]
    G -->|Issues| F
    G -->|Pass| H[Cleanup & Documentation]
    H -->|Run Build & Tests| I{All Pass?}
    I -->|No| F
    I -->|Yes| J[Commit]
```

## Key Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Write tests first** that define expected behavior
- Implement the simplest code that makes tests pass
- Refactor for cleanliness without changing behavior
- Create flow diagrams before implementation
- Focus on critical flows first

### Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
- Start with the minimum viable implementation
- Avoid premature optimization
- Solve one problem at a time
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Break complex problems into simpler parts
- Keep files under 300 lines
- Use standard patterns and approaches

### Iteration Over Perfection
- Expect multiple cycles through the build → test → fix loop
- Each iteration improves quality incrementally
- Feedback from each stage informs the next
- Accept that perfect is the enemy of done

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Planning: Define Tests First
Clearly define what "done" means before coding:
```javascript
// Example of writing tests first
test('Character sheet displays correct health value', () => {
  const sheet = render(<CharacterSheet health={50} maxHealth={100} />);
  expect(sheet.getByTestId('health-display')).toHaveTextContent('50/100');
});
```

### 2. Implementation: Minimal Viable Component
Implement just enough to meet the requirements:
```jsx
// Minimal implementation to pass the test
const CharacterSheet = ({ health, maxHealth }) => (
  <div data-testid="health-display">{health}/{maxHealth}</div>
);
```

### 3. Build → Test → Fix Loop
- **Fix build errors first** (like fixing syntax errors)
- **Run and fix Jest tests** (like running unit tests)
- **Manually test implementation** (like checking component rendering)
- Repeat until all pass

### 4. Documentation & Cleanup
Only after all tests pass:
- Remove debugging code (console.logs)
- Update documentation
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Ensure the code follows KISS principles

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Follow Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code by business domains
- **Maintain Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a single responsibility
- **Keep Files Small**: Max 300 lines per file
- **Use Clear Naming**: Names should convey purpose and behavior
- **Establish Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between systems

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Core business logic thoroughly tested
- **Component Testing**: UI components tested with React Testing Library
- **Integration Testing**: Key system boundaries have integration tests
- **End-to-End Testing**: Critical user flows have E2E tests
- **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for error states and boundary cases

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimize When Needed**: Only optimize after evidence of performance issues
- **Virtualize Large Lists**: Use virtualization for large data sets
- **Memoize Expensive Operations**: Apply useMemo/useCallback appropriately
- **Batch Updates**: Group related state updates
- **Lazy Load Components**: Only load components when needed

## AI-Assisted Development Guidelines

When working with Claude or other AI assistants:

### Planning Prompts
```
Help me plan tests for a [component] that needs to [functionality].
Focus on core functionality only, using KISS principles.
```

### Implementation Prompts
```
I need a minimal implementation of [component] that will pass these tests:
[paste tests]

Keep it as simple as possible while meeting requirements.
```

### Debugging Prompts
```
I have these build errors or failing tests:
[paste errors]

Help me fix them with minimal changes to maintain simplicity.
```

## Testing Concepts in React

| Traditional Concept | React Equivalent | Workflow Stage |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Requirements specification | Jest test expectations | Planning |
| Component API design | React component props interface | Planning |
| Component implementation | React component function | Implementation |
| Debug logging | console.log (temp during dev) | Implementation |
| Unit testing | Jest component tests | Testing |
| Integration testing | Manual React testing | Verification |
