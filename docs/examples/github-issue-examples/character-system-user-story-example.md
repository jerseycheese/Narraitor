# Example User Story for GitHub Issue: Character Creation Wizard

Below is an example of a user story formatted for GitHub issues, focused on the Character Creation Wizard component of the Character System.

```
[USER STORY] Implement Character Creation Wizard
```

## User Story
As a player, I want to create a character with attributes and skills defined by my selected world through a guided wizard so that I can have a persona for the narrative experience.

## Domain
- [ ] World Configuration
- [x] Character System
- [ ] Narrative Engine
- [ ] Journal System
- [ ] State Management
- [ ] AI Service Integration
- [ ] Game Session UI
- [ ] Utilities and Helpers
- [ ] Other: _________

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The wizard guides me through 4 clearly defined steps: Basic Info, Attributes, Skills, and Background
- [ ] In the Basic Info step, I can enter character name and short description
- [ ] In the Attributes step, I can allocate points to attributes defined by the selected world
- [ ] In the Skills step, I can select and rate up to 8 skills based on world definitions
- [ ] In the Background step, I can provide personality and history text for my character
- [ ] The wizard enforces world-defined constraints (min/max attribute values, skill ratings)
- [ ] I can navigate forward and backward between steps with proper state preservation
- [ ] I receive validation feedback for required fields and invalid entries
- [ ] I can see my remaining attribute points when allocating attributes
- [ ] Skill selection shows related attributes for each skill
- [ ] When completed, the wizard saves my character to state and redirects to character details view
- [ ] The UI adapts responsively to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Technical Requirements
- Must implement the wizard using a multi-step form pattern
- Must use the character state reducer for updates
- Must validate inputs according to world-defined constraints
- Must generate unique IDs for the character and its components
- Must preserve character state during navigation
- Must correctly associate character with selected world

## Implementation Notes
- Use React Hook Form for form management and validation
- Implement point-buy system for attributes with running total
- Consider using sliders or +/- controls for attribute allocation
- Show attribute descriptions on hover/focus for better context
- Skills should be filterable/searchable if world has many skills
- Consider markdown or simple formatting for background text areas
- Store form state in context to persist during navigation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented following TDD approach
- [ ] Unit tests cover all logic paths including validation scenarios
- [ ] Component has Storybook stories for all wizard steps
- [ ] Documentation updated with character creation guide
- [ ] Passes accessibility standards (keyboard navigation, screen reader)
- [ ] Responsive on all target devices
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified

## Priority
- [x] High (MVP)
- [ ] Medium (MVP Enhancement)
- [ ] Low (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Post-MVP

## Estimated Complexity
- [ ] Small (1-2 days)
- [x] Medium (3-5 days)
- [ ] Large (1+ week)
