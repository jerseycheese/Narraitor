# Example User Story for GitHub Issue: World Creation Wizard

Below is an example of a user story formatted for GitHub issues, focused on the World Creation Wizard component of the World Configuration System.

```
[USER STORY] Create World Creation Wizard Component
```

## User Story
As a game creator, I want to create a new world with custom settings through a step-by-step wizard so that I can establish the foundation for my narrative experience.

## Domain
- [x] World Configuration
- [ ] Character System
- [ ] Narrative Engine
- [ ] Journal System
- [ ] State Management
- [ ] AI Service Integration
- [ ] Game Session UI
- [ ] Utilities and Helpers
- [ ] Other: _________

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The wizard guides me through 4 clearly defined steps: Basic Info, Attributes, Skills, and Tone Settings
- [ ] In the Basic Info step, I can enter world name, description, genre, and select a theme
- [ ] In the Attributes step, I can add up to 6 attributes with name, description, and value range (1-10)
- [ ] In the Skills step, I can add up to 12 skills with name, description, and link to 1-2 attributes
- [ ] In the Tone Settings step, I can select narrative style, pacing, content rating, and language style
- [ ] I can navigate forward and backward between steps with proper state preservation
- [ ] I can abandon the wizard at any point with a confirmation prompt
- [ ] I receive validation feedback for required fields and invalid entries
- [ ] When completed, the wizard saves my world configuration to state and redirects to world details view
- [ ] The UI adapts responsively to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Technical Requirements
- Must implement the wizard using a multi-step form pattern
- Must use the world configuration reducer for state updates
- Must validate all form inputs before allowing progression
- Must generate unique IDs for the world and its components
- Must enforce limits (6 attributes max, 12 skills max)
- Must integrate with the theme system for preview

## Implementation Notes
- Use React Hook Form for form state management and validation
- Consider implementing a stepper component for step navigation
- Use optimistic UI updates with validation
- Implement form preservation if user navigates away accidentally
- Consider accessibility for all form controls and navigation
- Store wizard progress in local state until final submission

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented following TDD approach
- [ ] Unit tests cover all logic paths
- [ ] Component has Storybook stories (if UI component)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Passes accessibility standards (if applicable)
- [ ] Responsive on all target devices (if UI component)
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified

## Priority
- [x] High (MVP)
- [ ] Medium (MVP Enhancement)
- [ ] Low (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Post-MVP

## Estimated Complexity
