# AI World Suggestions - User Guide

## What are AI World Suggestions?

AI World Suggestions is a feature that helps you create richer, more detailed worlds by automatically suggesting appropriate attributes and skills based on your world description. Using advanced AI technology, Narraitor analyzes your world's theme and setting to provide contextually relevant suggestions.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Describe Your World
When creating a new world, provide a detailed description of your setting, themes, and unique aspects. The more detailed your description, the better the AI suggestions will be.

**Example Description:**
> "A mystical fantasy realm where ancient magic flows through crystalline ley lines. Dragons soar above floating islands while arcane scholars study in towering libraries. Warriors must balance physical prowess with magical knowledge to survive."

### Step 2: AI Analysis
After entering your description, the system will:
1. Analyze your world's themes and elements
2. Generate relevant attribute suggestions
3. Create appropriate skill recommendations
4. Link skills to their primary attributes

### Step 3: Review Suggestions
The AI will present suggestions for:
- **Attributes**: Core character traits (e.g., Strength, Arcane Power)
- **Skills**: Abilities characters can develop (e.g., Spellcasting, Dragon Riding)

### Step 4: Accept or Reject
You have full control over which suggestions to use:
- ✅ Click the checkbox to accept a suggestion
- ❌ Leave unchecked to reject it
- ✏️ Modify accepted suggestions to fit your vision

## Example Suggestions

### For a Fantasy World:
**Attributes:**
- Arcane Power (Magical energy and spellcasting ability)
- Dragon Affinity (Connection to draconic beings)
- Mystic Insight (Understanding of magical phenomena)

**Skills:**
- Spellcasting (Ability to cast magical spells)
- Dragon Riding (Skill in commanding and riding dragons)

## Tips for Better Suggestions

1. **Be Specific**: Include unique elements of your world
2. **Mention Themes**: Describe the tone and atmosphere
3. **Include Conflicts**: Explain challenges characters might face
4. **Note Technology/Magic Level**: Specify if it's high fantasy, low magic, etc.
