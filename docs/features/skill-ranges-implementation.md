# Skill Ranges Implementation (Issue #290)

This document details the implementation approach for GitHub Issue #290, which required configuring numeric ranges and default values for character skills.

## Overview

Issue #290 required a way for game creators to set default values for character skills within a fixed range of 1-5. The implementation needed to provide an intuitive UI for setting these values and include descriptive labels for each skill level to help users understand what the values represent.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Constants and Types

We created a dedicated constants file for skill level descriptions:

```typescript
// src/lib/constants/skillLevelDescriptions.ts
export const MIN_SKILL_VALUE = 1;
export const MAX_SKILL_VALUE = 5;

export const SKILL_LEVEL_DESCRIPTIONS = [
  { value: 1, label: 'Novice', description: 'Beginner understanding with limited skill' },
  { value: 2, label: 'Apprentice', description: 'Basic proficiency with room for improvement' },
  { value: 3, label: 'Competent', description: 'Solid performance in most situations' },
  { value: 4, label: 'Expert', description: 'Advanced mastery with consistent results' },
  { value: 5, label: 'Master', description: 'Complete mastery at professional level' },
];
```

We also standardized skill difficulty levels in another constants file:

```typescript
// src/lib/constants/skillDifficultyLevels.ts
export type SkillDifficulty = 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
export const DEFAULT_SKILL_DIFFICULTY: SkillDifficulty = 'medium';

export const SKILL_DIFFICULTIES = [
  { value: 'easy', label: 'Easy', description: 'Quick to learn and apply, even for beginners' },
  // ...etc
];
```

### 2. Reusable UI Components

We created reusable UI components to ensure consistency:

1. **RangeSlider Component**: A general-purpose range slider with support for level descriptions
2. **SkillDifficulty Component**: A visual indicator of skill difficulty levels

### 3. Specialized Range Editors

We refactored existing range editors to use our new reusable components:

1. **SkillRangeEditor**: Specialized for skills using the 1-5 scale with level descriptions
2. **AttributeRangeEditor**: Specialized for attributes, using the same RangeSlider but with different scale

### 4. Integration with Forms

We updated the WorldSkillsForm to use the new components and constants:

```typescript
// When creating a new skill
const newSkill: WorldSkill = {
  name: '',
  description: '',
  category: '',
  difficulty: DEFAULT_SKILL_DIFFICULTY,
  minValue: MIN_SKILL_VALUE,
  maxValue: MAX_SKILL_VALUE,
  baseValue: 3, // Default to middle value 
  // ...other properties
};
```

### 5. Integration with Wizard Flow

We updated the SkillReviewStep in the WorldCreationWizard to work with the updated skill range system:

```typescript
// Ensuring skills are included by default
const handleSkillToggle = (skillName: string, newAccepted: boolean) => {
  const updatedSkills = [...currentData.skills];
  const skillIndex = updatedSkills.findIndex(s => s.name === skillName);
  
  if (skillIndex >= 0) {
    updatedSkills[skillIndex] = {
      ...updatedSkills[skillIndex],
      accepted: newAccepted
    };
    updateData({ skills: updatedSkills });
  }
};
```

## Implementation Decisions

1. **Fixed Range of 1-5**: We settled on a fixed range of 1-5 for skills to keep the system simple and intuitive for users. This aligns with many tabletop RPG systems and provides enough granularity without overwhelming users.

2. **Descriptive Labels**: Each skill level has both a numeric value (1-5) and a descriptive label (Novice, Apprentice, etc.) to help users understand what the values represent.

3. **Centralized Constants**: By putting all skill level and difficulty constants in dedicated files, we ensure consistency throughout the application and make it easy to modify these values if needed.

4. **Component Reuse**: The RangeSlider component is designed to be reusable for both skills and attributes, even though they use different scales.

5. **Automatic Value Clamping**: If a skill has a value outside the 1-5 range (for example, from legacy data), it will be automatically clamped to the valid range.

## Testing Approach

Our testing strategy included:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing each component in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing the components working together
3. **Visual Verification**: Using Storybook to verify the visual appearance
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Testing with various edge cases (min/max values, disabled state, etc.)

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. **Customizable Ranges**: Allow game creators to define their own skill ranges and level descriptions
2. **Skill Recommendations**: Provide recommended skill values based on character archetypes
3. **Visual Enhancements**: Add more visual representations of skill levels (icons, progress bars, etc.)
4. **Value Distribution**: Tools to help balance skill values across a character
5. **Comparative Views**: Allow comparing skill values across multiple characters

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for skill value configuration while keeping the interface intuitive and user-friendly. The system is designed to be extensible for future enhancements while meeting the current requirements efficiently.
