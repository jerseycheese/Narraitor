# World Deletion Feature

This feature allows users to delete worlds they no longer need, with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **DeleteConfirmationDialog** - Reusable confirmation dialog component
   - Location: `/src/components/DeleteConfirmationDialog`
   - Features: Modal dialog with cancel/confirm actions
   
2. **WorldCard Integration** - Delete button on world cards
   - Location: `/src/components/WorldCard/WorldCard.tsx`
   - Shows confirmation dialog before deletion

3. **worldStore** - Delete action already exists
   - Location: `/src/state/worldStore.ts`
   - Action: `deleteWorld(id: EntityID)`

### User Flow

1. User clicks delete button on a world card
2. Confirmation dialog appears with world name
3. User can:
   - Click "Cancel" to abort deletion
   - Click "Delete" to confirm deletion
   - Press Escape key to cancel
   - Click outside dialog to cancel
4. If confirmed, world is deleted from store
5. World list updates immediately
6. Deletion persists between sessions

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - DeleteConfirmationDialog component tests
   - worldStore deleteWorld action tests

2. **Storybook**
   - DeleteConfirmationDialog stories at "Narraitor/Common/DeleteConfirmationDialog"

3. **Test Harness**

4. **Integration**
   - Test at `/worlds` in full application
