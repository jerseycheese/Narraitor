# World Editing Feature

## Overview
The world editing feature allows users to modify existing worlds after initial creation. This feature is accessed via the "Edit" button on world cards in the world list.

## Features

### Complete World Editing
Users can edit all aspects of a world:
- Basic information (name, description, theme)
- Attributes (add, edit, remove)
- Skills (add, edit, remove, link to attributes)
- World settings (limits and point pools)

### Form Components
The world editing interface is built using reusable form components:
- `WorldBasicInfoForm` - Edits name, description, and theme
- `WorldAttributesForm` - Manages world attributes
- `WorldSkillsForm` - Manages world skills
- `WorldSettingsForm` - Configures world settings

These components are located in `/src/components/forms/` for reusability.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
/world/[id]/edit (page) 
  └── WorldEditor (component)
      ├── WorldBasicInfoForm
      ├── WorldAttributesForm
      ├── WorldSkillsForm
      └── WorldSettingsForm
```

### State Management
- Uses `worldStore` for loading and saving world data
- Implements optimistic UI updates
- Form state is managed locally within the WorldEditor component

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks "Edit" button on a world card
2. Routes to `/world/[id]/edit`
3. WorldEditor loads world data from store
4. User makes changes
5. Save commits changes to store
6. Cancel discards changes
7. Both actions navigate back to `/worlds`

## Usage

### Accessing World Editor
From the world list, click the "Edit" button on any world card.
