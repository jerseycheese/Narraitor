# Implementation Summary: Issue #301 - Error Handling for AI Service Unavailability

## Overview
The original issue requested pre-written fallback content during AI service unavailability. However, after analysis, we pivoted to implement proper error handling with retry functionality instead.

## Key Decision
We determined that pre-written fallback content would break immersion by showing contextually inappropriate content (e.g., forest descriptions appearing in desert settings). This led us to implement a simpler, more honest approach: clear error messages with retry functionality that maintains player control and narrative coherence.

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified
1. **NarrativeDisplay** - Added ErrorDisplay integration with retry support
2. **NarrativeHistory** - Passes retry callback through component hierarchy
3. **NarrativeController** - Implements context-aware retry logic

### Error Handling Features
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry button for user-initiated recovery
- Context preservation during errors
- Loading states during retry attempts

## Benefits
1. **Maintains Immersion** - No jarring pre-written content
2. **User Control** - Clear retry options
3. **Simplicity** - Follows KISS principles
4. **Consistency** - Uses existing ErrorDisplay component

## Testing
- Added unit tests for retry functionality
- Verified error states in NarrativeDisplay
- Manual testing scenarios documented
