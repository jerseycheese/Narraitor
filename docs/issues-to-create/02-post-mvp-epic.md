## Plain Language Summary
Build upon the MVP engagement enhancements with advanced gamification features, comprehensive lore management, and sophisticated narrative cohesion systems to create a deeply engaging and personalized storytelling experience.

## Epic Description
This epic represents the evolution from basic engagement features to advanced narrative systems. It includes AI-powered text analysis, visual journey tracking, achievement systems, and comprehensive lore validation to prevent contradictions and enhance narrative coherence.

## Domain
- [x] Narrative Engine
- [x] AI Service Integration
- [x] Lore Management System
- [x] Player Decision System
- [ ] World Configuration
- [ ] Character System
- [ ] Journal System
- [ ] State Management
- [ ] Other: _________

## Goals
1. **Advanced Text Intelligence**: AI-powered chunking that adapts to narrative complexity and pacing
2. **Visual Progress Systems**: Journey visualization and achievement tracking for player engagement
3. **Comprehensive Lore Management**: Advanced contradiction detection and narrative coherence validation
4. **Personalized Experience**: Adaptive difficulty and reading analytics for tailored gameplay
5. **Rich Interactive Elements**: Context-aware tooltips and knowledge-gated UI systems

- [ ] #[TBD]: Multi-Path Story Arc Visualization

## Research Foundation
Building on successful patterns from:
- **Disco Elysium**: Thought Cabinet and narrative inventory systems
- **Heaven's Vault**: Contextual tooltips with archaeological discovery mechanics
- **Kentucky Route Zero**: Theatrical presentation and player-as-director concepts
- **Visual Novels**: Dual display modes (ADV/NVL) and auto-play features
- **Twine Games**: Crossed-out choices showing character limitations

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement Depth**: Average session duration increased by 30%
- **Discovery Rate**: 80% of players discover hidden lore through tooltips
- **Achievement Completion**: 60% of players unlock narrative achievements
- **Personalization**: Reading pace adapts correctly for 90% of users
- **Narrative Coherence**: Zero reported major lore contradictions
- **Visual Appeal**: Positive feedback on journey visualization features

## Timeline
**Phase 1**: Core Intelligence Systems (4-6 weeks)
- AI text analysis and adaptive chunking
- Basic achievement framework
- Context-aware tooltips

**Phase 2**: Visual & Progress Systems (4-6 weeks)
- Journey visualization
- Achievement UI and tracking
- Progress indicators

**Phase 3**: Advanced Coherence (6-8 weeks)
- Lore contradiction detection
- Narrative cohesion validation
- Multi-path visualization

## Technical Architecture
### AI Integration
- Advanced prompt engineering for semantic text analysis
- Token optimization for complex narrative contexts
- Real-time content adaptation based on player behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for achievement and visualization systems
- Efficient caching for tooltip content
- Background processing for lore validation

### Data Structures
- Graph-based narrative path tracking
- Hierarchical achievement trees
- Indexed lore database with relationship mapping
