## Plain Language Summary
Implement intelligent text chunking that uses AI to analyze narrative content and determine optimal break points based on scene tension, emotional beats, and story pacing rather than just character count.

## User Story
As a player, I want the narrative text to be intelligently chunked based on story context and pacing so that dramatic moments feel impactful and quiet moments allow for reflection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AI analyzes narrative content for tension levels, emotional intensity, and pacing
- [ ] Text chunks dynamically adjust size based on scene type (action: shorter, reflection: longer)
- [ ] Natural language processing identifies optimal break points at semantic boundaries
- [ ] Cliffhangers and dramatic reveals are preserved at chunk boundaries
- [ ] System learns from player reading speed and adjusts chunk sizes accordingly
- [ ] Fallback to character-based chunking if AI analysis fails
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with <100ms processing time per chunk

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/ai/narrativeAnalyzer.ts` for semantic content analysis
- [ ] Implement tension detection algorithm using NLP techniques
- [ ] Add `pacing` field to narrative segments: 'slow' | 'normal' | 'intense'
- [ ] Create adaptive chunking algorithm that considers multiple factors
- [ ] Integrate with existing Gemini API for content analysis
- [ ] Add caching layer for analyzed chunks to improve performance
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for API failures

## Implementation Considerations
**AI Analysis Pipeline:**
- Extract narrative text for analysis
- Identify key elements: dialogue, action, description, internal monologue
- Calculate tension score based on word choice, sentence structure, punctuation
- Determine optimal chunk boundaries preserving narrative flow
- Cache results for similar content patterns

**Adaptive Algorithm Factors:**
- Scene tension level (0-10 scale)
- Presence of dialogue vs. description
- Sentence complexity and length
- Punctuation patterns (!, ?, ...)
- Player's historical reading speed
- Time of day / session duration

**Performance Optimization:**
- Pre-process narrative during generation, not display
- Use Web Workers for background analysis
- Implement progressive enhancement (basic first, then refine)
- Cache analysis results by content hash
