## Plain Language Summary
Create an intelligent tooltip system that reveals character backstories, world lore, and relationship details based on what the player has already discovered, creating a sense of archaeological discovery in the narrative.

## User Story
As a player, I want to hover over or tap on highlighted narrative elements to discover additional context, lore, and character information that deepens based on my progression so that the world feels rich and discoverable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Key narrative elements (characters, locations, items, concepts) are subtly highlighted
- [ ] Tooltips show progressive disclosure: basic info → detailed lore → secret knowledge
- [ ] Player discoveries are tracked and unlock deeper tooltip content
- [ ] Mobile-friendly tap interactions with smooth animations
- [ ] Tooltips reference player's previous discoveries and choices
- [ ] Visual indicators show when new tooltip content is available
- [ ] Accessibility support with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with 50+ tooltips on screen

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/components/Narrative/TooltipSystem.tsx` component
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/lore/discoveryTracker.ts` for progression tracking
- [ ] Enhance `loreStore` to track discovery levels per lore item
- [ ] Implement tooltip content hierarchy system
- [ ] Create highlighting algorithm for narrative text parsing
- [ ] Add tooltip preloading for smooth hover experience
- [ ] Implement mobile gesture handling for touch devices
- [ ] Create visual discovery indicator system

## Implementation Considerations
**Discovery Progression System:**
```typescript
interface LoreDiscovery {
  id: string;
  levels: {
    basic: string;        // Always visible
    detailed: string;     // After first interaction
    secret: string;       // After specific conditions met
    master: string;       // After multiple related discoveries
  };
  unlockConditions: {
    interactions: number;
    relatedDiscoveries: string[];
    specificChoices: string[];
    timeInGame: number;
  };
}
```

**Tooltip Behavior Patterns:**
- **Hover delay**: 500ms before showing (configurable)
- **Smart positioning**: Avoid viewport edges, narrative text overlap
- **Smooth transitions**: Fade in/out with 200ms duration
- **Content loading**: Prefetch on narrative segment load
- **Mobile behavior**: Tap to show, tap elsewhere to hide

**Visual Design:**
- Subtle underline or glow for discoverable elements
- Color coding for discovery level (faded → bright)
- Small icon indicators for tooltip type (character, location, lore)
- Progress indicators showing discovery completion

**Performance Considerations:**
- Virtual scrolling for long narrative segments
- Intersection Observer for viewport detection
- Content lazy loading based on scroll position
- Tooltip pooling to reuse DOM elements
