## Plain Language Summary
Create a visual representation of the player's journey through the narrative, showing branching paths, key decisions, and the unique story they've created through their choices.

## User Story
As a player, I want to see a visual map of my narrative journey showing the paths I've taken, choices I've made, and how my story differs from other possibilities so that I feel ownership over my unique experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive journey map showing narrative flow as connected nodes
- [ ] Player's path highlighted distinctly from unexplored branches
- [ ] Key decisions marked with icons and choice text
- [ ] Zoom and pan controls for exploring large narrative maps
- [ ] Chapter/session markers for easy navigation
- [ ] Click nodes to read narrative segments and choices
- [ ] Visual indicators for story importance (size, color, glow)
- [ ] Export journey as image for sharing
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design with touch controls

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/components/Journey/JourneyVisualization.tsx` component
- [ ] Implement graph data structure for narrative paths
- [ ] Use D3.js or React Flow for graph rendering
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/journey/graphBuilder.ts` for data transformation
- [ ] Add journey data to `narrativeStore` with relationships
- [ ] Implement viewport controls and minimap
- [ ] Create image export functionality (SVG/PNG)
- [ ] Add performance optimization for large graphs (500+ nodes)

## Implementation Considerations
**Graph Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface NarrativeNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'start' | 'decision' | 'scene' | 'ending';
  content: {
    title: string;
    preview: string;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  importance: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  visited: boolean;
  sessionId: string;
}

interface NarrativeEdge {
  id: string;
  source: string;
  target: string;
  label?: string;  // Choice text
  taken: boolean;
  type: 'main' | 'branch' | 'loop';
}
```

**Visualization Features:**
- **Layout Algorithm**: Force-directed for organic flow
- **Node Types**: Different shapes/colors for scenes, decisions, endings
- **Edge Styling**: Solid for taken paths, dashed for possibilities
- **Clustering**: Group nodes by chapter/session
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions when exploring
- **Filtering**: Show/hide based on importance, time, type

**Performance Optimization:**
- Virtual rendering for off-screen nodes
- Level-of-detail system (simplify distant nodes)
- Progressive loading for large journeys
- WebGL rendering for 1000+ nodes

**Visual Design:**
- Dark theme with glowing paths (like constellation map)
- Color coding for emotional tone of scenes
- Particle effects along active paths
- Fog of war for unexplored areas
- Time-based gradient showing progression
