## Plain Language Summary
Implement an achievement system specifically designed for narrative games that rewards story exploration, character development, creative choices, and discovering hidden content rather than traditional gaming metrics.

## User Story
As a player, I want to earn achievements for making interesting narrative choices, discovering hidden lore, and exploring different story paths so that I feel motivated to engage deeply with the narrative.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 30+ narrative-focused achievements at launch
- [ ] Real-time achievement unlocking with satisfying notifications
- [ ] Achievement categories: Story, Exploration, Creativity, Relationships, Secrets
- [ ] Progress tracking for multi-part achievements
- [ ] Achievement journal showing unlocked/locked with hints
- [ ] Rarity indicators based on player statistics
- [ ] Share individual achievements on social media
- [ ] Achievement points contributing to player level/rank
- [ ] New Game+ achievements for different path exploration

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/state/achievementStore.ts` with Zustand
- [ ] Create `/src/components/Achievements/` component system
- [ ] Implement achievement checking engine with event listeners

## Implementation Considerations
**Achievement Types:**
```typescript
interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  category: 'story' | 'exploration' | 'creativity' | 'relationships' | 'secrets';
  name: string;
  description: string;
  hint?: string;  // Shown when locked
  icon: string;
  points: number;
  rarity: 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'epic' | 'legendary';
  
  // Unlock conditions
  conditions: {
    type: 'choice' | 'discovery' | 'combination' | 'counter' | 'special';
    requirements: any;  // Type varies by condition type
  };
  
  // Progress tracking
  progress?: {
    current: number;
    target: number;
    display: string;  // e.g., "3/5 ancient texts discovered"
  };
}
```
