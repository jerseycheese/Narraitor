## Plain Language Summary
Create an intelligent system that monitors player engagement patterns and automatically adjusts narrative complexity, choice difficulty, and pacing to maintain optimal challenge and prevent both boredom and overwhelm.

## User Story
As a player, I want the game to automatically adjust its narrative complexity based on how I'm engaging with the story so that I always feel appropriately challenged without being overwhelmed or bored.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System tracks reading speed, choice time, and session patterns
- [ ] Narrative complexity adjusts across multiple dimensions
- [ ] Smooth transitions between complexity levels (no jarring changes)
- [ ] Player can manually override with difficulty preferences
- [ ] Visual indicators show current complexity level
- [ ] Analytics dashboard shows personalization effectiveness
- [ ] Works across different genres and world types
- [ ] Preserves author intent while adapting presentation

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/analytics/engagementTracker.ts` for metrics
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/ai/complexityAdapter.ts` for adjustments
- [ ] Enhance narrative generation with complexity parameters
- [ ] Add complexity scoring to existing narrative segments
- [ ] Implement real-time adjustment engine
- [ ] Create player preference UI in settings
- [ ] Add complexity visualization components
- [ ] Integrate with existing AI prompt system

## Implementation Considerations
**Engagement Metrics:**
```typescript
interface EngagementMetrics {
  readingSpeed: {
    wordsPerMinute: number;
    trend: 'increasing' | 'stable' | 'decreasing';
  };
  choicePatterns: {
    averageTimeToChoice: number;
    skippedReadingPercentage: number;
    customChoiceUsage: number;
  };
  sessionBehavior: {
    averageSessionLength: number;
    breakPoints: string[];  // Where players typically stop
    returnRate: number;
  };
  comprehension: {
    loreDiscoveryRate: number;
    consistentChoices: boolean;
    backtracking: number;
  };
}
```

**Complexity Dimensions:**
1. **Vocabulary Complexity** (simple → advanced)
   - Word frequency analysis
   - Sentence length variation
   - Technical terminology usage

2. **Narrative Structure** (linear → complex)
   - Flashbacks and time jumps
   - Multiple POV switches
   - Subplot density

3. **Choice Complexity** (binary → nuanced)
   - Number of options (2-6)
   - Moral ambiguity level
   - Long-term consequences visibility

4. **Emotional Intensity** (light → heavy)
   - Emotional vocabulary density
   - Conflict intensity
   - Psychological depth

**Adaptation Algorithm:**
- Calculate optimal complexity score (0-10) per dimension
- Gradual adjustments (±1 per session max)
- Hysteresis to prevent oscillation
- Genre-specific baselines
- Player preference weighting

**AI Prompt Modifications:**
```
Complexity Level: 7/10
- Vocabulary: Advanced but not archaic
- Structure: Include one flashback
- Choices: 4 options with moral ambiguity
- Emotional: Moderate psychological depth
```
