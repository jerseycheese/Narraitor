## Plain Language Summary
Build an advanced system that actively detects and prevents contradictions in the narrative by analyzing relationships between facts, tracking temporal consistency, and validating new content against established lore.

## User Story
As a player, I want the narrative to remain internally consistent even across long play sessions so that the story world feels coherent and my suspension of disbelief is maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time contradiction detection during narrative generation
- [ ] Temporal consistency checking (timeline validation)
- [ ] Character behavior consistency across scenes
- [ ] Location/geography consistency validation
- [ ] Automatic correction suggestions for minor conflicts
- [ ] GM-style notifications for major contradictions
- [ ] Contradiction report UI for debugging
- [ ] Performance maintains sub-200ms generation impact

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/lore/contradictionEngine.ts` core system
- [ ] Implement graph database for fact relationships
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/lore/temporalValidator.ts` for timeline checks
- [ ] Build `/src/lib/lore/characterConsistency.ts` for behavior validation
- [ ] Enhance AI prompts with consistency constraints
- [ ] Create contradiction resolution UI components
- [ ] Implement fact relationship mapping system
- [ ] Add validation hooks to narrative generation pipeline

## Implementation Considerations
**Fact Relationship Model:**
```typescript
interface FactNode {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  type: 'character' | 'location' | 'event' | 'rule' | 'item';
  timestamp?: Date;  // When it occurred in story
  source: {
    segmentId: string;
    confidence: number;  // 0-1, AI extraction confidence
  };
  
  relationships: Array<{
    targetId: string;
    type: 'contradicts' | 'supports' | 'requires' | 'excludes';
    strength: number;  // 0-1
    reason?: string;
  }>;
}

interface ContradictionCheck {
  severity: 'minor' | 'major' | 'critical';
  facts: string[];  // Fact IDs involved
  description: string;
  suggestedResolution?: string;
  canAutoResolve: boolean;
}
```

**Contradiction Types:**
1. **Temporal Contradictions**
   - Event ordering conflicts
   - Character age inconsistencies
   - Time travel paradoxes

2. **Spatial Contradictions**
   - Impossible travel times
   - Location description conflicts
   - Geographic impossibilities

3. **Character Contradictions**
   - Personality inconsistencies
   - Knowledge they shouldn't have
   - Being in two places at once

4. **World Rule Contradictions**
   - Magic system violations
   - Technology anachronisms
   - Social structure conflicts

**Detection Pipeline:**
1. Extract facts from new narrative segment
2. Build relationship graph with existing facts
3. Run validation algorithms by type
4. Score contradictions by severity
5. Generate resolution suggestions
6. Present to AI or player for resolution

**Resolution Strategies:**
- **Auto-resolve**: Minor issues like word choice
- **AI Rewrite**: Regenerate with constraints
- **Player Choice**: "Which version is correct?"
- **Retcon System**: Update past facts consistently
