## Plain Language Summary
Implement comprehensive reading analytics that track how players engage with text, then use this data to personalize narrative pacing, session length, and break points for optimal engagement.

## User Story
As a player, I want the game to understand my reading habits and automatically pace the narrative to match my preferences so that I can enjoy sessions that feel neither rushed nor dragging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Track reading speed across different content types
- [ ] Identify optimal session length for individual players
- [ ] Predict natural break points based on behavior
- [ ] Adjust narrative pacing without changing content
- [ ] Provide reading analytics dashboard
- [ ] Privacy-first design with opt-in analytics
- [ ] Export personal reading data on request
- [ ] Works across devices with synced profiles

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/analytics/readingAnalytics.ts` tracking system
- [ ] Build `/src/lib/personalization/pacingEngine.ts`
- [ ] Implement privacy-compliant data storage
- [ ] Create analytics visualization components
- [ ] Add pacing hooks to narrative display
- [ ] Build prediction algorithms for break points
- [ ] Create user preference learning system
- [ ] Implement cross-device profile sync

## Implementation Considerations
**Reading Analytics Data:**
```typescript
interface ReadingSession {
  id: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  segments: Array<{
    segmentId: string;
    wordCount: number;
    readingTime: number;
    scrollEvents: Array<{time: number; position: number}>;
    interactions: Array<{type: string; time: number}>;
    abandoned: boolean;
  }>;
  
  patterns: {
    averageWPM: number;
    speedVariance: number;
    preferredChunkSize: number;
    scrollBehavior: 'smooth' | 'jumpy' | 'methodical';
    rereadingFrequency: number;
  };
  
  context: {
    timeOfDay: string;
    deviceType: string;
    sessionNumber: number;
    previousSessionGap: number;
  };
}
```

**Personalization Dimensions:**
1. **Reading Speed Profiles**
   - Fast readers: 300+ WPM, prefer larger chunks
   - Moderate: 200-300 WPM, standard pacing
   - Careful: <200 WPM, smaller chunks, more breaks

2. **Session Patterns**
   - Quick breaks: 5-10 minute sessions
   - Standard: 15-30 minute sessions
   - Deep dive: 30+ minute sessions
   - Variable: No consistent pattern

3. **Engagement Indicators**
   - High: Consistent speed, few breaks, rereading
   - Medium: Some scrolling, moderate breaks
   - Low: Fast scrolling, skipping, early exits

4. **Content Preferences**
   - Dialogue vs. description preference
   - Action vs. reflection engagement
   - Complex vs. simple narrative preference

**Pacing Adjustments:**
- Insert natural break points at predicted intervals
- Adjust text chunk sizes based on reading speed
- Vary narrative intensity to match session patterns
- Suggest session end at optimal points
- Preload content based on predicted reading speed

**Privacy Features:**
- All analytics stored locally by default
- Opt-in cloud sync with encryption
- Data retention limits (90 days default)
- Complete data export in standard format
- One-click analytics deletion
- Anonymous aggregated insights only
