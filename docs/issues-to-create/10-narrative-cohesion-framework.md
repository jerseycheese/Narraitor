## Plain Language Summary
Create a comprehensive framework that ensures narrative cohesion not just within individual playthroughs but across all players in a world, maintaining canon while allowing for player agency and unique stories.

## User Story
As a world creator, I want a system that maintains narrative cohesion across all players while preserving individual agency so that my world feels consistent and alive regardless of how many different stories unfold within it.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] World creators can define canon events and flexible story spaces
- [ ] System tracks aggregate player choices to identify emergent patterns
- [ ] Soft canon system allows popular player choices to influence world lore
- [ ] Narrative boundaries prevent world-breaking contradictions
- [ ] Creator dashboard shows narrative health metrics
- [ ] Players see how their choices align with or diverge from others
- [ ] Retroactive canon updates propagate gracefully
- [ ] System handles 1000+ concurrent player narratives

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/cohesion/worldCanonSystem.ts`
- [ ] Build `/src/lib/cohesion/narrativeBoundaries.ts`
- [ ] Implement aggregate choice tracking system
- [ ] Create world creator cohesion dashboard
- [ ] Build canon propagation engine
- [ ] Add soft canon voting/weight system
- [ ] Create narrative health monitoring
- [ ] Implement cross-player influence algorithms

## Implementation Considerations
**World Canon Structure:**
```typescript
interface WorldCanon {
  id: string;
  worldId: string;
  
  fixedCanon: Array<{
    id: string;
    type: 'event' | 'character' | 'location' | 'rule';
    content: string;
    flexibility: 'immutable' | 'soft' | 'emergent';
    violationSeverity: 'warning' | 'prevent' | 'adapt';
  }>;
  
  narrativeBoundaries: Array<{
    id: string;
    description: string;
    checkType: 'prevent' | 'warn' | 'influence';
    conditions: any;  // Complex rule system
  }>;
  
  emergentCanon: Array<{
    id: string;
    originatingChoices: string[];
    adoptionThreshold: number;  // % of players needed
    currentAdoption: number;
    status: 'proposed' | 'trending' | 'canon';
  }>;
}
```

**Cohesion Monitoring:**
```typescript
interface CohesionMetrics {
  narrativeDivergence: number;  // 0-100 score
  canonViolations: Array<{
    severity: 'minor' | 'major' | 'critical';
    frequency: number;
    resolution: 'prevented' | 'adapted' | 'accepted';
  }>;
  emergentPatterns: Array<{
    pattern: string;
    playerCount: number;
    growthRate: number;
  }>;
  healthScore: number;  // Overall world narrative health
}
```

**Soft Canon Evolution:**
1. Track all player choices and outcomes
2. Identify patterns (>10% adoption)
3. Surface to world creator as "emerging canon"
4. Creator can promote to soft or fixed canon
5. System adapts future narratives accordingly

**Boundary Examples:**
- "The king cannot die before the harvest festival"
- "Magic users must have discovered the ancient tome"
- "The northern pass remains closed until Act 3"
- "Character relationships must respect established orientations"

**Cross-Player Influences:**
- Rumors system: Popular choices become ambient knowledge
- Shared world events: Major player actions affect others
- Collective canon: Democratic story evolution
- Parallel universes: Incompatible narratives split
