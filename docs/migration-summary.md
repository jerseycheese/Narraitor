# Work Progress Summary

## Task Overview
We've been enhancing the NarrAItor project planning by creating a robust Node.js script to migrate user stories from markdown requirements into GitHub issues in the `jerseycheese/narraitor` repository.

## Scope Boundaries
What IS included:
- Extraction of user stories from markdown documents under `docs/requirements`.
- Filtering by `--domain` parameter.
- Batched processing with `--limit`/`--skip`.
- Dry-run previews of issue payloads.
- Creation of GitHub issues via API using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md`.
- Domain listing functionality.

What is NOT included:
- Implementation of application code.
- Unit tests for the migration script.
- CI/CD workflows.
- Adding new dependencies beyond Node.js built-ins.
- Overriding existing project structure.
- Feature enhancements beyond the defined MVP scope.

## Current Status
- Migration script consolidated and templated.
- Redundant `migrate-all-user-stories.js` removed.
- Dry-run validated for `world-configuration` domain (7 payloads).
- Actual issue creation run produced 3 issues.

## Completed Steps
1. Enhanced initial migration script with domain filtering, batching, and dry-run.
2. Tested dry-run for `world-configuration` domain (7 payloads).
3. Executed actual issue creation for `world-configuration` (3 issues).
4. Consolidated scripts and removed redundant file.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate GitHub issue template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md`) into the script.
2. Validate dry-run with templated output for `world-configuration`.
3. Migrate remaining domains in domain-specific batches.
4. Begin core Utilities & Helpers implementation.

## TDD & KISS Status
- Tests written first: No (script tested via dry-run).
- Component size compliance: Yes (script under 300 lines).
- Storybook stories status: N/A.
- Utilities leveraged: `fs`, `path`, `https` modules.

## Technical Context
- Node.js script processing markdown and calling GitHub API.
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
- Requirements follow structured markdown with `##` headers.

## Pending Decisions
- Confirm acceptance criteria placeholders in issues.
- Choose next domain to migrate (e.g., `utilities-and-helpers`).
- Decide on timing for CI/CD integration.
