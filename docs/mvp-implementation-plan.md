# NarrAItor MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the NarrAItor project. It focuses on delivering essential functionality with a phased approach, ensuring a working product that can be iteratively enhanced.

## MVP Goals

1. Create a working narrative RPG framework that supports different fictional worlds
2. Implement essential systems for character creation and management
3. Provide a basic AI-driven narrative experience
4. Include a journal system for tracking game history
5. Ensure state persistence between sessions
6. Deliver a clean, maintainable codebase following best practices

## Core Systems Scope

### World Configuration System (MVP)
- Basic world creation and editing
- Simple attribute and skill system definition
- Three template worlds (Western, Sitcom, Adventure)
- World import/export functionality
- No hardcoded world-specific content

### Character System (MVP)
- Basic character creation wizard
- Attribute and skill assignment
- Simple character description
- Optional AI portrait generation
- Character storage and retrieval

### Narrative Engine (MVP)
- Basic scene generation
- Simple player choices (3-5 options per scene)
- Minimal context management
- Basic history tracking
- World-appropriate text generation

### Journal System (MVP)
- Basic entry creation
- Simple entry viewing
- Chronological organization
- Entry persistence

### State Management (MVP)
- Domain-specific reducers
- IndexedDB persistence
- Type-safe state manipulation
- Import/export functionality

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup (1 week)
- Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Configure Storybook for component development
- Create initial project structure
- Set up GitHub workflows and PR templates

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (1 week)
- Implement core type definitions
- Set up state management architecture
- Create persistence layer with IndexedDB
- Implement basic UI components
- Set up routing and navigation

### Phase 3: World Configuration (1 week)
- Implement world configuration reducer
- Create world editor components
- Develop world template system
- Add import/export functionality
- Create test worlds

### Phase 4: Character System (1 week)
- Implement character state reducer
- Create character creation wizard
- Develop attribute and skill management
- Add basic portrait generation
- Create character storage and retrieval

### Phase 5: Narrative Engine (1-2 weeks)
- Implement AI service integration
- Create prompt template system
- Develop scene generation
- Add player choice handling
- Implement history tracking

### Phase 6: Journal and Integration (1 week)
- Implement journal system
- Create entry generation from narrative events
- Develop journal viewer
- Integrate all systems
- Add basic error handling

### Phase 7: Testing and Polish (1 week)
- Complete unit test coverage
- Add integration tests
- Implement end-to-end tests
- Improve UI and responsiveness
- Fix bugs and issues

## Development Approach

### TDD Workflow
1. Define requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Create flow diagrams for features
3. Write tests to define expected behavior
4. Implement minimal code to pass tests
5. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
6. Repeat for each feature

### Component Development
1. Define component API and props
2. Create Storybook stories for each variant
3. Develop component in isolation
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Integrate into application flow

### State Management
1. Define domain-specific actions and types
2. Create pure reducers for state updates
3. Implement context providers
4. Add persistence with IndexedDB
5. Create selectors for UI components

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
2. **State Management**: React Context + useReducer pattern
3. **Persistence**: IndexedDB for local storage
4. **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for styling
5. **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
6. **Component Development**: Storybook-first approach
7. **AI Integration**: Google Gemini models (configurable)

## MVP Deliverables

1. **Working Application**
   - World configuration system
   - Character creation and management
   - Basic narrative engine
   - Simple journal system
   - State persistence

2. **Documentation**
   - System architecture documentation
   - User guides
   - Component documentation in Storybook
   - Flow diagrams and type definitions

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - End-to-end tests for critical flows

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create and configure basic world settings
2. Character creation works with a minimal attribute/skill system
3. The narrative engine generates appropriate content for different worlds
4. The journal system records game events
5. The state management system persists game state between sessions
6. The application runs with acceptable performance
7. Core user journeys are covered by tests
8. The codebase follows established best practices

## Timeline

- **Planning Phase**: Complete (Current)
- **MVP Development**: 6-8 weeks
- **Testing and Validation**: 1-2 weeks
- **Initial Release**: 8-10 weeks from start

## Risk Management

1. **AI Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: AI model limitations or integration issues
   - Mitigation: Create fallback content generation methods

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Adding features beyond MVP scope
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to defined boundaries

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Risk: Shortcuts taken to meet timeline
   - Mitigation: Maintain code quality standards and testing

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Slow application performance
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing and optimization

## Next Steps After MVP

1. **Enhanced Narrative Engine**
   - Improved AI integration
   - Better context management
   - Memory systems

2. **NPC System**
   - Basic NPC generation
   - Relationship tracking
   - NPC portraits

3. **Advanced Character Features**
   - Character advancement
   - Equipment management
   - Character history

4. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Enhanced visualizations
   - Improved responsiveness
   - Accessibility enhancements

5. **Additional Worlds**
   - More template worlds
   - Enhanced world customization
   - World sharing capabilities
