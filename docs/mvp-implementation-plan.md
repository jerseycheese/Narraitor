   - **Contingency**: Prepare alternative AI providers or simplified rule-based fallbacks

2. **IndexedDB Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Challenges with IndexedDB implementation, browser compatibility issues
   - **Mitigation**: Use established library (idb), implement comprehensive error handling, add storage quota management
   - **Contingency**: Create localStorage fallback for critical data

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Risk**: Slow application performance with large datasets or complex state
   - **Mitigation**: Implement state normalization, use selector memoization, optimize renders
   - **Contingency**: Add state pruning for older entries, implement pagination

4. **Next.js App Router Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Unexpected limitations or performance issues with App Router
   - **Mitigation**: Keep up with Next.js updates, test core functionality early
   - **Contingency**: Prepare fallback to Pages Router if necessary

5. **Error Recovery Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Difficulty implementing robust error recovery for all failure scenarios
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize recovery for critical paths, implement comprehensive logging
   - **Contingency**: Simplify recovery options and focus on data preservation

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Feature expansion beyond MVP boundaries
   - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to requirements, regular scope review, clear documentation of out-of-scope features
   - **Contingency**: Maintain prioritized backlog for post-MVP enhancements

2. **Technical Debt**
   - **Risk**: Shortcuts to meet timeline leading to future issues
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain TDD discipline, enforce code standards, regular refactoring
   - **Contingency**: Schedule technical debt sprints after MVP if necessary

3. **Solo Developer Bottlenecks**
   - **Risk**: Development slowdowns due to solo developer context
   - **Mitigation**: Focused implementation plan, regular progress tracking, clear documentation
   - **Contingency**: Identify features that could be simplified if timeline is threatened

4. **User Experience Gaps**
   - **Risk**: Usability issues due to UI/UX limitations
