# Post-MVP Systems

## Overview
This document tracks systems that have been designed but deferred to post-MVP to focus on the core narrative experience and faster time to market.

## Deferred Systems

### Gamification System
**Status**: Design complete, implementation deferred  
**Priority**: Post-MVP  
**Reason**: Focus on core narrative experience first  
**Date**: January 2025  
**GitHub Epic**: #429

**Description**: Comprehensive engagement and reward system including:
- Achievement system for player milestones
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Reward mechanics for continued play
- Experience points and leveling systems
- Unlockable content and features
- Leaderboards and social features
- Daily/weekly challenges
- Narrative engagement metrics

### Inventory System
**Status**: Implementation complete, UI deferred  
**Priority**: Post-MVP  
**Reason**: Not essential for core narrative experience  
**Date**: May 2025  

**Description**: Full inventory management system with item tracking, categories, equipment, and AI-driven categorization. The backend system is fully functional and tested but UI components will not be exposed until post-MVP.

**GitHub Issues**: #164, #168, #169, #238, #239, #241, #242, #243, #244, #246, #247

### Content Preferences System
**Status**: Design phase  
**Priority**: Post-MVP  
**Reason**: MVP focuses on standard content generation  
**Date**: January 2025  

**Description**: Advanced content customization allowing users to:
- Set content boundaries and preferences
- Customize narrative themes and tones
- Filter content types
- Adjust violence/romance/language levels
- Create custom content rules
- Save preference profiles per world

### Advanced AI Features
**Status**: Conceptual  
**Priority**: Post-MVP  
**Reason**: Core AI functionality sufficient for MVP  
**Date**: January 2025  

**Description**: Enhanced AI capabilities including:
- Multi-model support (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Advanced context management
- Character voice customization
- Dynamic world evolution
- AI-generated portraits and imagery
- Predictive narrative branching
- Learning from player preferences

### Lore Management System
**Status**: Requirements gathering  
**Priority**: Post-MVP  
**Reason**: Not essential for initial gameplay  
**Date**: January 2025  

**Description**: Comprehensive world-building tools:
- Lore document creation and management
- World history tracking
- NPC relationship mapping
- Location descriptions and maps
- Custom rule systems
- World sharing and templates

### Mobile Application
**Status**: Previously planned, now deferred  
**Priority**: Post-MVP  
**Reason**: Web-first approach for faster launch  
**Date**: TBD based on user demand  

**Description**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android with:
- Offline play capability
- Touch-optimized interface
- Push notifications
- Mobile-specific features
- App store distribution

## Integration Notes

### Backend Preparedness
- Inventory system store remains fully functional
- All deferred systems have defined interfaces
- State management architecture supports future additions
- No breaking changes required for activation

### Activation Priorities
Post-MVP systems will be activated based on:
1. User feedback and demand
2. Revenue goals and sustainability
3. Technical complexity
4. Market differentiation needs

## Re-activation Plan

To activate any post-MVP system:

### For Backend-Complete Systems (e.g., Inventory)
1. Create UI components following existing patterns
2. Add navigation/menu items
3. Update game session to include system
4. Remove post-MVP notes from documentation
5. Close related GitHub issues

### For New Systems
1. Complete technical design document
2. Create implementation epic with user stories
3. Follow standard TDD development process
4. Integrate with existing state management
5. Add comprehensive test coverage
6. Deploy behind feature flag initially

## Success Criteria for Activation

A post-MVP system should be activated when:
- Core MVP is stable and successful
- Clear user demand exists (via feedback/analytics)
- Development resources are available
- Business model supports expansion
- Technical debt is manageable

## Timeline Considerations

**Q1 2025**: Focus on MVP launch and stabilization  
**Q2 2025**: Evaluate first post-MVP feature based on user feedback  
**Q3 2025**: Consider mobile development if web platform successful  
**Q4 2025**: Expand based on growth metrics and user base

**Note**: This document will be reviewed monthly post-launch to adjust priorities based on real user needs and business metrics.
