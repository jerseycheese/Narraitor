# Auto-Approval Implementation PR Notes

## Changes Made
1. Created a helper script `/scripts/fetch-github-issue.sh` to fetch GitHub issue details without prompting for permission
2. Updated all Claude Code command files to use this helper script:
   - `/Users/jackhaas/Projects/narraitor/.claude/commands/do-issue.md`
   - `/Users/jackhaas/Projects/narraitor/.claude/commands/do-issue-auto.md`
   - `/Users/jackhaas/Projects/narraitor/.claude/commands/analyze-issue.md`
3. Updated `CLAUDE.md` to document the new helper script approach
4. Added a test script in `/scripts/test-auto-approval.sh` to verify the helper script works correctly

## Purpose
These changes streamline the workflow automation by removing the need for manual approval when fetching GitHub issue details. This reduces interruptions and makes the custom Claude Code commands more efficient.

## How It Works
We've created a dedicated helper script that Claude Code commands can use to fetch GitHub issue details. Since this is a specific, isolated script with a clear purpose, it's easier to get approved once and then reused across all commands.

## Testing
The helper script has been tested and confirmed to work correctly:
```bash
./scripts/fetch-github-issue.sh 292
```
The script fetches issue #292 details without showing any permission prompt.

## Next Steps
1. Consider creating additional helper scripts for other common GitHub API operations
2. Monitor workflow automation to identify other potential improvements
3. Consider automating more steps in the PR creation process
