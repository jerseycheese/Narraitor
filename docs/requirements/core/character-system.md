# Character System Requirements

## Overview
The Character System provides functionality for creating, managing, and representing player characters within the narrative world. It allows players to define their in-game personas based on the attributes and skills defined by the selected world configuration.

## Core Functionality
- **Character Creation**: Step-by-step wizard for creating characters
- **Attribute Assignment**: Allocation of attribute points based on world configuration
- **Skill Selection**: Selection and rating of skills based on world configuration
- **Character Description**: Text-based description of character appearance and personality
- **Character Storage**: Save and retrieve character data
- **Character List**: View and manage multiple characters
- **Character Editing**: Modify existing characters

## Data Model

```typescript
interface Character {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  worldId: string;  // Reference to the world this character belongs to
  description: string;
  personality: string;
  background: string;
  attributes: CharacterAttribute[];
  skills: CharacterSkill[];
  portraitUrl?: string;  // Optional AI-generated portrait
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface CharacterAttribute {
  id: string;
  definitionId: string;  // Reference to the attribute definition in the world
  name: string;  // Cached for convenience
  value: number;
}

interface CharacterSkill {
  id: string;
  definitionId: string;  // Reference to the skill definition in the world
  name: string;  // Cached for convenience
  value: number;
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users create characters through a guided wizard interface
- Users allocate attribute points according to world constraints
- Users select and rate skills based on world definitions
- Users provide text descriptions of character appearance and personality
- Users optionally generate an AI portrait for their character
- Users view, edit, and delete existing characters

## Integration Points
- **World System**: Uses attribute and skill definitions from the selected world
- **Narrative Engine**: Provides character context for narrative generation
- **Journal System**: Provides character information for journal entries
- **State Management**: Persists character data between sessions
- **AI Service**: Optional integration for generating character portraits and descriptions

## MVP Scope Boundaries
