Calculate relevance scores,"As a developer, I want to calculate multi-factor relevance scores for past decisions so that the most applicable ones are prioritized for AI context.",High (MVP),Medium,"The system calculates a composite relevance score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each past decision.\nThe scoring algorithm considers multiple factors including recency, tag matches, and impact.\nThe calculated scores (`overallScore`, `recencyScore`, etc.) are stored in the `DecisionRelevanceScore` object.\nHigher scoring decisions are prioritized for inclusion in the AI context.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/130,"The system must calculate relevance scores for past decisions based on multiple factors. It must accept a decision and the current narrative context as inputs. The system must consider factors such as recency, tag matches, and impact in its calculations. Results must be stored in a structured format for use in prioritization.","Consider how different factors should be weighted in the overall relevance calculation. Think about the mathematical approach for combining scores from different factors. Balance computational efficiency against scoring accuracy since this may run frequently.","docs/requirements/core/decision-relevance-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Weight recent decisions,"As a developer, I want to weight recent decisions more heavily so that the narrative maintains recency bias for coherence.",High (MVP),Small,The recency score decreases proportionally as the time difference between the decision and the current context increases.\nThe recency weighting is configurable via the `maxAge` parameter.\nVery old decisions (beyond `maxAge`) receive minimal or zero recency score.\nThe formula for recency decay is consistently applied across all decisions.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/131,"The system must calculate a recency score based on the time difference between decision creation and the current time. Older decisions must receive lower scores according to a decay function. The system must respect a configurable maximum age parameter beyond which decisions have minimal relevance.","Consider what type of decay function (linear, exponential, etc.) would best represent how decision relevance decreases over time. Think about edge cases such as decisions with missing timestamps or decisions far beyond the maximum age.","docs/requirements/core/decision-relevance-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Configure algorithm parameters,"As a developer, I want to configure relevance algorithm parameters so that the system can be tuned for optimal performance.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,"The relevance algorithm parameters (`recencyWeight`, `tagMatchWeight`, `importanceWeight`, etc.) can be adjusted in the `RelevanceConfig`.\nChanges to configuration parameters take effect immediately for subsequent relevance calculations.\nParameters have reasonable default values that work without manual configuration.\nParameter values are validated to ensure they remain within acceptable ranges.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/132,"The system must provide a way to configure and adjust relevance algorithm parameters. It must include reasonable default values that work without manual configuration. Parameter changes must take effect immediately for subsequent calculations. The system must validate parameter values to ensure they remain within acceptable ranges.","Consider the initialization timing of configuration values and how they might be adjusted during runtime. Think about validation rules for different parameters and what constitutes reasonable defaults that balance different relevance factors effectively.","docs/requirements/core/decision-relevance-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Implement tag matching,"As a developer, I want to implement tag matching between decisions and current context so that thematically relevant decisions are prioritized.",High (MVP),Medium,The `tagMatchScore` increases based on the number of matching tags between the decision's tags and the `currentTags` in the `NarrativeContext`.\nDecisions that share multiple tags with the current context receive higher scores than those with fewer matches.\nThe tag matching algorithm handles both exact and partial tag matches.\nTag matching is case-insensitive to prevent mismatches due to capitalization differences.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/133,"The system must compare tags associated with past decisions against tags in the current narrative context. It must calculate match scores based on the number and quality of matches. The system must handle case-insensitivity in tag comparison and support both exact and partial tag matching.","Consider the scoring algorithm for different types of matches (exact vs. partial). Think about performance implications when comparing large sets of tags. The tag matching should balance accuracy with computational efficiency.","docs/requirements/core/decision-relevance-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Assess decision importance,"As a developer, I want to assess the importance of decisions based on their classification so that significant decisions have appropriate influence.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,Decisions have classification metadata that indicates their relative importance.\nThe system uses this classification to calculate an appropriate `importanceScore`.\nMore significant decisions receive higher importance scores in the relevance calculation.\nThe importance weighting can be configured in the `RelevanceConfig`.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/134,"The system must recognize decision classification metadata that indicates relative importance. It must use this classification to calculate an appropriate importance score. Classifications representing more significant decisions must result in higher importance scores. The system must support configurable importance weighting.","Consider what classification levels are most appropriate for the narrative context. Think about how importance weights should scale across different classification levels. The implementation should allow for future refinement of the classification scheme.","docs/requirements/core/decision-relevance-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
