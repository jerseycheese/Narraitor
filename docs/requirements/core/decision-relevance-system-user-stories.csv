Calculate relevance scores,"As a developer, I want to calculate multi-factor relevance scores for past decisions so that the most applicable ones are prioritized for AI context.",High (MVP),Medium,"The system calculates a composite relevance score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each past decision.\nThe scoring algorithm considers multiple factors including recency, tag matches, and impact.\nThe calculated scores (`overallScore`, `recencyScore`, etc.) are stored in the `DecisionRelevanceScore` object.\nHigher scoring decisions are prioritized for inclusion in the AI context.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/130
Weight recent decisions,"As a developer, I want to weight recent decisions more heavily so that the narrative maintains recency bias for coherence.",High (MVP),Small,The recency score decreases proportionally as the time difference between the decision and the current context increases.\nThe recency weighting is configurable via the `maxAge` parameter.\nVery old decisions (beyond `maxAge`) receive minimal or zero recency score.\nThe formula for recency decay is consistently applied across all decisions.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/131
Configure algorithm parameters,"As a developer, I want to configure relevance algorithm parameters so that the system can be tuned for optimal performance.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,"The relevance algorithm parameters (`recencyWeight`, `tagMatchWeight`, `impactWeight`, etc.) can be adjusted in the `RelevanceConfig`.\nChanges to configuration parameters take effect immediately for subsequent relevance calculations.\nParameters have reasonable default values that work without manual configuration.\nParameter values are validated to ensure they remain within acceptable ranges.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/132
Implement tag matching,"As a developer, I want to implement tag matching between decisions and current context so that thematically relevant decisions are prioritized.",High (MVP),Medium,The `tagMatchScore` increases based on the number of matching tags between the decision's tags and the `currentTags` in the `NarrativeContext`.\nDecisions that share multiple tags with the current context receive higher scores than those with fewer matches.\nThe tag matching algorithm handles both exact and partial tag matches.\nTag matching is case-insensitive to prevent mismatches due to capitalization differences.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/133
Assess decision importance,"As a developer, I want to assess the importance of decisions based on their classification so that significant decisions have appropriate influence.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,Decisions have classification metadata that indicates their relative importance.\nThe system uses this classification to calculate an appropriate `importanceScore`.\nMore significant decisions receive higher importance scores in the relevance calculation.\nThe importance weighting can be configured in the `RelevanceConfig`.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/134
