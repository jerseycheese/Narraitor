Toggle DevTools panel,"As a developer, I want to toggle the DevTools panel with a keyboard shortcut so that I can quickly access debugging tools.",High (MVP),Small,The main `DevToolsPanel` can be toggled visible/hidden using the Ctrl+Shift+D keyboard shortcut in development environments.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/145

Debug component visibility,"As a developer, I want debug-only components with visibility toggles so that I can control which debugging tools are displayed.",High (MVP),Medium,DevTools components are only rendered and included in the build when the application is run in a development environment (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`).\nIndividual debugging components can be toggled visible/hidden within the DevTools panel.\nComponent visibility state persists across page refreshes.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/147
View application state,"As a developer, I want to view the complete application state so that I can understand the current system status.",High (MVP),Medium,"The `StateInspector` section displays the current application state (e.g., from Redux or Context).\nThe state is displayed in a readable format (e.g., using a `JsonViewer`).\nState data is refreshed automatically when it changes.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/148
Modify application state,"As a developer, I want basic state modification capabilities so that I can test different state scenarios.",High (MVP),Medium,"Basic state values (strings, numbers, booleans) can be modified directly through the DevTools UI.\nChanges to state values are reflected immediately in the application.\nState modification history is tracked and displayed.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/149
