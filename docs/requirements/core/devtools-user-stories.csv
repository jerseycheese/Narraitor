Toggle DevTools panel,"As a developer, I want to toggle the DevTools panel with a keyboard shortcut so that I can quickly access debugging tools.",High (MVP),Small,The main `DevToolsPanel` can be toggled visible/hidden using the Ctrl+Shift+D keyboard shortcut in development environments.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/145,"The system must provide a way to show and hide the developer tools panel via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D). It must track the visibility state of the panel and render or hide components accordingly.","Consider how to handle keyboard shortcuts safely without interfering with other application functionality. The panel visibility state should be managed appropriately for the application architecture. Think about accessibility implications when implementing keyboard shortcuts.","docs/requirements/core/devtools.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Collapse DevTools sections,"As a developer, I want to collapse and expand sections in the DevTools panel so that I can focus on relevant information.",High (MVP),Small,"Individual sections within the panel (e.g., State Inspector, AI Debugger) can be collapsed and expanded.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/146,"The system must support collapsible/expandable sections within the developer tools panel. Each section must have a visible way to toggle its expanded state. The system must maintain the collapsed/expanded state of each section.","Consider creating reusable collapsible section functionality that can be applied consistently across different debug panels. Think about whether section states should persist between sessions or page refreshes.","docs/requirements/core/devtools.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Debug component visibility,"As a developer, I want debug-only components with visibility toggles so that I can control which debugging tools are displayed.",High (MVP),Medium,DevTools components are only rendered and included in the build when the application is run in a development environment (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`).\nIndividual debugging components can be toggled visible/hidden within the DevTools panel.\nComponent visibility state persists across page refreshes.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/147,"The system must only include developer tools in development environments. It must provide controls to toggle the visibility of individual debugging components. Component visibility preferences must persist between page refreshes.","Consider how to ensure developer tools don't impact production builds. Think about an appropriate storage mechanism for persisting visibility preferences. The visibility toggles should be intuitive and centrally located in the developer tools interface.","docs/requirements/core/devtools.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
View application state,"As a developer, I want to view the complete application state so that I can understand the current system status.",High (MVP),Medium,"The `StateInspector` section displays the current application state (e.g., from Redux or Context).\nThe state is displayed in a readable format (e.g., using a `JsonViewer`).\nState data is refreshed automatically when it changes.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/148,"The system must provide a way to access and display the current application state. It must format the state data in a readable manner. The displayed state must update automatically when the underlying state changes.","Consider how to access state data regardless of the state management approach used. Think about how to present complex state structures in a way that's easy to understand. The display should update efficiently without causing performance issues when state changes frequently.","docs/requirements/core/devtools.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Modify application state,"As a developer, I want basic state modification capabilities so that I can test different state scenarios.",High (MVP),Medium,"Basic state values (strings, numbers, booleans) can be modified directly through the DevTools UI.\nChanges to state values are reflected immediately in the application.\nState modification history is tracked and displayed.",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/149,"The system must allow modifying basic state values through the developer tools interface. Modified values must be immediately reflected in the application. The system must track and display a history of state modifications.","Consider the safest approach to modify state values without causing application instability. Think about how to provide appropriate controls for different data types. The history tracking should provide context about what changed and when.","docs/requirements/core/devtools.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
