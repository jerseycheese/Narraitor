Toggle DevTools panel,"As a developer, I want to toggle the DevTools panel with a keyboard shortcut so that I can quickly access debugging tools",High (MVP),Small,The main `DevToolsPanel` can be toggled visible/hidden using the Ctrl+Shift+D keyboard shortcut in development environments.,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/145,"The system must provide a way to show and hide the developer tools panel via keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D). It must track the visibility state of the panel and render or hide components accordingly","Consider how to handle keyboard shortcuts safely without interfering with other application functionality. The panel visibility state should be managed appropriately for the application architecture. Think about accessibility implications when implementing keyboard shortcuts","docs/requirements/core/devtools.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md","#146\n#147\n#160\n#147\n#160"
