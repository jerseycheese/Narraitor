# Inventory System Requirements

## Overview
The Inventory System allows players to manage their character's possessions, equipment, and collectible items within the narrative world. While not essential to the core narrative experience, it adds depth and immersion by tracking meaningful objects that can influence the story and character capabilities.

## Core Functionality
- **Item Management**: Add, remove, and organize items in character inventory
- **Item Properties**: Define and track item attributes and effects
- **Item Categories**: Organize items by type and function
- **Item Interactions**: Use, combine, or examine items
- **Item Persistence**: Store inventory state between sessions
- **Inventory Limits**: Enforce realistic limitations on carried items
- **Item Relevance**: Integrate items into narrative context
- **Equipment System**: Equip items to enhance character abilities
- **Item Descriptions**: Provide detailed information about items
- **Item Acquisition**: Track when and how items are obtained

## Data Model

```typescript
interface Inventory {
  id: string;
  characterId: string;
  items: InventoryItem[];
  maxItems?: number;
  maxWeight?: number;
  currentWeight?: number;
  categories: InventoryCategory[];
  equipped: Record<string, string[]>; // slot -> itemIds
  lastUpdated: number;
}

interface InventoryItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  shortDescription: string;
  quantity: number;
  maxStackSize: number;
  type: string; // weapon, armor, consumable, key, etc.
  weight: number;
  value: number;
  categoryId: string;
  tags: string[];
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  isEquippable: boolean;
  equipSlot?: string[];
  effects?: ItemEffect[];
  iconType?: string;
  acquiredAt: number;
  acquiredLocation?: string;
  acquiredMethod?: string;
  isQuestItem?: boolean;
  narrativeRelevance?: string;
}

interface InventoryCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  order: number;
  iconType?: string;
  itemTypes: string[];
}

interface ItemEffect {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  target: string;
  value: number | string | boolean;
  duration?: number;
  condition?: string;
  description: string;
}

interface EquipmentSlot {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  allowedTypes: string[];
  maxItems: number;
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users view their character's inventory during gameplay
- Users examine item details and descriptions
- Users organize items by category or function
- Users use or activate items within the narrative
- Users equip or unequip items to affect character capabilities
- Users combine items to create new ones (post-MVP)
- Users drop or discard unwanted items
- Users track narrative-significant items in their inventory
- Users receive feedback when obtaining new items
- Users manage limited inventory space or weight constraints

## Integration Points
- **Character System**: Associates inventory with specific characters
- **Narrative Engine**: Incorporates items into narrative context
- **Journal System**: Records significant item acquisitions
- **State Management**: Persists inventory data between sessions
- **Game Session UI**: Provides inventory access during gameplay
- **World System**: Defines world-appropriate items and categories

## MVP Scope Boundaries

### Excluded from MVP
The Inventory System is considered a post-MVP feature. All functionality described in this document is planned for future development phases after the core MVP is completed. This document serves as a comprehensive reference for post-MVP planning.

### Post-MVP Implementation (Phase 1)
- Basic inventory management with:
  - Item list with name, description, and quantity
  - Simple categorization (weapons, tools, consumables, etc.)
  - Add/remove functionality
  - Basic item properties
  - Item examination
  - Persistence between sessions
- Simple equipment system with:
  - Equip/unequip functionality
  - Basic equipment slots (weapon, armor, etc.)
  - Equipment effects on character attributes
- Inventory UI with:
  - List view of all items
  - Category filters
  - Item detail view
  - Basic search functionality
- Narrative integration with:
  - Reflection of key items in narrative
  - Item acquisition recorded in journal
  - Basic item usage in narrative choices

### Post-MVP Exclusions (Future Phases)
- Complex crafting systems
- Item degradation/durability
- Item enchantment or modification
- Trade systems with NPCs
- Item economy with pricing
- Container management (bags within bags)
- Advanced item combinations
- Visual item representations
- Equipment appearance on character
- Item-based puzzles
- Advanced weight/encumbrance systems

## User Stories

1. **Inventory Management**
   - As a player, I want to view a list of my character's possessions so I know what I'm carrying
   - As a player, I want to examine items in detail so I understand their properties and purpose
   - As a player, I want to organize items by category so I can find them easily
   - As a player, I want to drop or discard unwanted items so I can manage limited inventory space

2. **Item Interaction**
   - As a player, I want to use items in my inventory so they can affect the narrative or my character
   - As a player, I want to equip weapons or armor so my character's capabilities reflect their equipment
   - As a player, I want to see when an item is relevant to the current situation so I can use it appropriately
   - As a player, I want to track quest-related items so I know their importance to the story

3. **Equipment Management**
   - As a player, I want to equip items to specific slots so my character benefits from their effects
   - As a player, I want to see how equipped items affect my character's attributes so I understand their impact
   - As a player, I want to compare items before equipping them so I can make informed decisions
   - As a player, I want to unequip items when they're no longer useful so I can replace them with better ones

4. **Narrative Integration**
   - As a player, I want items to be mentioned in the narrative when relevant so they feel integrated with the story
   - As a player, I want to acquire items through narrative events so my inventory reflects my journey
   - As a player, I want narrative choices that involve using my items so they become meaningful gameplay elements
   - As a player, I want to see a record of significant items I've acquired in my journal so I can track my progress
