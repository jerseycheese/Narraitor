# Inventory System Requirements

## Overview
The Inventory System allows players to manage their character's possessions within the narrative world. For the MVP, it focuses on tracking a basic list of items, allowing players to use them, equip/unequip them, and automatically categorizing them upon acquisition using AI.

## Core Functionality
- **Item Management**: Add and remove items in character inventory
- **Item Usage**: Allow players to use items from their inventory, potentially reducing quantity
- **Basic Equipment**: Allow players to equip and unequip items
- **Item Categorization**: Automatically categorize items upon acquisition using AI
- **Item Persistence**: Store basic inventory state between sessions
- **Item Acquisition**: Track when and how items are obtained (basic)

## Data Model

```typescript
interface Inventory {
  id: string;
  characterId: string;
  items: BasicInventoryItem[];
  categories: InventoryCategory[]; // Include categories in the MVP Data Model
  lastUpdated: number;
}

interface BasicInventoryItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string; // Basic description
  quantity: number;
  categoryId: string; // Item should have a category ID
  isEquipped: boolean; // Track equipped status
  acquiredAt: number;
  acquiredLocation?: string;
  acquiredMethod?: string;
}

interface InventoryCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  itemTypes?: string[]; // Optional: may not need complex types for MVP
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users view a list of their character's items during gameplay, potentially grouped by category.
- Users add items to their inventory (system-driven based on narrative events).
- Users remove items from their inventory (system-driven or via basic UI).
- Users use items from their inventory via the UI.
- Users equip and unequip items via the UI.
- Users can see which items are currently equipped.

## Integration Points
- **Character System**: Associates inventory with specific characters.
- **Narrative Engine**: Inventory data is available for narrative context, item usage can influence the narrative. Provides context for item acquisition.
- **Journal System**: Records item acquisitions.
- **State Management**: Persists inventory data between sessions.
- **Game Session UI**: Provides access to the inventory list and ability to use items.
- **AI Service**: Used to automatically categorize items upon acquisition.

## MVP Scope Boundaries

### Included
- Basic inventory management system with:
  - Tracking of items by name, description, and quantity.
  - Ability to add items to a character's inventory (primarily system-driven upon acquisition).
  - Ability to remove items from a character's inventory (primarily system-driven or via basic UI).
  - Ability to use items and reduce their quantity if necessary.
  - Persistence of inventory state between sessions using IndexedDB.
- Basic Inventory UI:
  - A simple list view displaying items in a character's inventory (Name, Quantity, optional Description).
  - Items can be used via an action in the UI.
  - Items are displayed with their category indicated (e.g., grouping or label).
- Basic equip/unequip functionality:
  - Ability to equip items without advanced effects or equipment slots.
  - Ability to unequip items.
  - Simple indication of equipped status in the inventory UI.
- Basic Narrative Integration:
  - Inventory data is available for the narrative engine (e.g., to mention items the character has).
  - Item acquisition can be recorded in the journal, including the AI-assigned category.
  - Items can be used to affect the narrative.
- AI Categorization upon Acquisition:
  - When an item is acquired through a narrative event, the AI service automatically assigns it to a predefined category.
  - A limited set of predefined categories for items.
- DevTools integration to expose helpful info/debug tools

### Excluded
- Advanced inventory features (e.g., item properties beyond basic description/quantity, weight/limits, stacking).
- Advanced equipment system features (item effects, equipment slots).
- Item interactions beyond simple adding/removing/using/equipping (e.g., combining, examining detailed properties).
- Complex Inventory UI features (e.g., category filters, item detail view, search, sorting, visual representations, drag-and-drop, custom categories).
- Inventory limits or capacity management.
- Item relevance tracking within the Inventory System itself (handled by Narrative Engine).
- Manual categorization by the user.
- Complex AI analysis for categorization beyond basic text matching.
- Any features listed under "Post-MVP Exclusions (Future Phases)" in the original document.

## User Stories

1. **Item Management**
- As a player, I want to view a list of items my character possesses so I know what they are carrying (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)
- As a player, I want to add items to my character's inventory so they can use or equip them later (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)
- As a player, I want to remove items from my character's inventory when they're no longer needed (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)

2. **Item Usage**
- As a player, I want to use items from my inventory so they can affect the narrative (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)
- As a player, I want used consumable items to be automatically removed from my inventory when depleted (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)

3. **Equipment Management**
- As a player, I want to equip items from my inventory so my character can use them (Complexity: Medium, Priority: Medium)
- As a player, I want to unequip items when they're no longer needed (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)
- As a player, I want to see which items are currently equipped at a glance (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)

4. **Item Categorization**
- As a player, I want items to be automatically categorized upon acquisition so they're easier to find (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)
- As a player, I want to see item categories in the inventory view for better organization (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)

5. **Narrative Integration**
- As a player, I want the narrative to acknowledge the items my character has so the story feels personalized (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)
- As a player, I want my equipped items to be reflected in the narrative so my choices matter (Complexity: Small, Priority: Medium)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system can track a list of items associated with a character.
2. Items can be added to and removed from a character's inventory programmatically.
3. Items can be used via the Inventory UI.
4. Using an item reduces its quantity, removing the item if quantity reaches zero.
5. Players can equip and unequip items through the Inventory UI.
6. The Inventory UI clearly indicates which items are currently equipped.
7. Inventory state persists correctly between sessions.
8. A basic list of items is displayed in the Inventory UI, showing category information.
9. Inventory data is accessible by the Narrative Engine.
10. Item acquisition events can be recorded in the Journal, including the assigned category.
11. Item usage can trigger narrative effects via the Narrative Engine.
12. The Inventory UI is responsive on desktop and mobile.
13. When items are acquired via narrative events, the AI automatically assigns a category.
14. Items are stored with their assigned category ID.
15. Equipped items retain their equipped status between sessions.

## BootHillGM Reference Code
- The inventory implementation in `/app/components/Inventory.tsx` provides a proven structure for inventory management, which can be referenced for the basic MVP list view and add/remove logic, as well as potentially category display.
- The inventory reducer in `/app/reducers/inventory/inventoryReducer.ts` offers a solid model for inventory state management patterns, including categories.
- BootHillGM's integration of items with narrative choices (though more advanced than MVP) and journal integration can serve as a conceptual reference.
- The AI service implementation in BootHillGM (`/app/services/ai/aiService.ts`) can be referenced for patterns on integrating AI for tasks like categorization.
