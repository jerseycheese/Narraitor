# Inventory System Requirements

## Overview
The Inventory System allows players to manage their character's possessions within the narrative world. For the MVP, it focuses on tracking a basic list of items, allowing players to use them, equip/unequip them, and automatically categorizing them upon acquisition using AI.

## Core Functionality
- **Item Management**: Add and remove items in character inventory
- **Item Usage**: Allow players to use items from their inventory, potentially reducing quantity
- **Basic Equipment**: Allow players to equip and unequip items
- **Item Categorization**: Automatically categorize items upon acquisition using AI
- **Item Persistence**: Store basic inventory state between sessions
- **Item Acquisition**: Track when and how items are obtained (basic)

## Data Model

```typescript
interface Inventory {
  id: string;
  characterId: string;
  items: BasicInventoryItem[];
  categories: InventoryCategory[]; // Include categories in the MVP Data Model
  lastUpdated: number;
}

interface BasicInventoryItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string; // Basic description
  quantity: number;
  categoryId: string; // Item should have a category ID
  isEquipped: boolean; // Track equipped status
  acquiredAt: number;
  acquiredLocation?: string;
  acquiredMethod?: string;
}

interface InventoryCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  itemTypes?: string[]; // Optional: may not need complex types for MVP
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users view a list of their character's items during gameplay, potentially grouped by category.
- Users add items to their inventory (system-driven based on narrative events).
- Users remove items from their inventory (system-driven or via basic UI).
- Users use items from their inventory via the UI.
- Users equip and unequip items via the UI.
- Users can see which items are currently equipped.

## Integration Points
- **Character System**: Associates inventory with specific characters.
- **Narrative Engine**: Inventory data is available for narrative context, item usage can influence the narrative. Provides context for item acquisition.
- **Journal System**: Records item acquisitions.
- **State Management**: Persists inventory data between sessions.
- **Game Session UI**: Provides access to the inventory list and ability to use items.
- **AI Service**: Used to automatically categorize items upon acquisition.

## MVP Scope Boundaries

### Included
- Basic inventory management system with:
  - Tracking of items by name, description, and quantity.
  - Ability to add items to a character's inventory (primarily system-driven upon acquisition).
  - Ability to remove items from a character's inventory (primarily system-driven or via basic UI).
  - Ability to use items and reduce their quantity if necessary.
  - Persistence of inventory state between sessions using IndexedDB.
- Basic Inventory UI:
  - A simple list view displaying items in a character's inventory (Name, Quantity, optional Description).
  - Items can be used via an action in the UI.
  - Items are displayed with their category indicated (e.g., grouping or label).
- Basic equip/unequip functionality:
  - Ability to equip items without advanced effects or equipment slots.
  - Ability to unequip items.
  - Simple indication of equipped status in the inventory UI.
- Basic Narrative Integration:
  - Inventory data is available for the narrative engine (e.g., to mention items the character has).
  - Item acquisition can be recorded in the journal, including the AI-assigned category.
  - Items can be used to affect the narrative.
- AI Categorization upon Acquisition:
  - When an item is acquired through a narrative event, the AI service automatically assigns it to a predefined category.
  - A limited set of predefined categories for items.
- DevTools integration to expose helpful info/debug tools

### Excluded
- Advanced inventory features (e.g., item properties beyond basic description/quantity, weight/limits, stacking).
- Advanced equipment system features (item effects, equipment slots).
- Item interactions beyond simple adding/removing/using/equipping (e.g., combining, examining detailed properties).
- Complex Inventory UI features (e.g., category filters, item detail view, search, sorting, visual representations, drag-and-drop, custom categories).
- Inventory limits or capacity management.
- Item relevance tracking within the Inventory System itself (handled by Narrative Engine).
- Manual categorization by the user.
- Complex AI analysis for categorization beyond basic text matching.
- Any features listed under "Post-MVP Exclusions (Future Phases)" in the original document.

## BootHillGM Reference Code
- The inventory implementation in `/app/components/Inventory.tsx` provides a proven structure for inventory management, which can be referenced for the basic MVP list view and add/remove logic, as well as potentially category display.
- The inventory reducer in `/app/reducers/inventory/inventoryReducer.ts` offers a solid model for inventory state management patterns, including categories.
- BootHillGM's integration of items with narrative choices (though more advanced than MVP) and journal integration can serve as a conceptual reference.
- The AI service implementation in BootHillGM (`/app/services/ai/aiService.ts`) can be referenced for patterns on integrating AI for tasks like categorization.
