Record narrative events,"As a player, I want the system to automatically record important narrative events so I can review them later.",High (MVP),Medium,"The system automatically creates journal entries for major narrative events\nEach entry includes timestamp, world ID, character ID, and session ID\nEntry content accurately reflects the narrative event\nEntries are assigned the correct type ('narrative')\nNarrative entries are formatted with proper paragraph structure",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/260,"The system must capture and record important narrative events as they occur. Each journal entry must include essential metadata (timestamp, IDs) to establish context.

Think about how to format narrative content to maintain readability while preserving the original meaning and tone. The recording process should be non-intrusive to the game experience.","docs/requirements/core/journal-system.md, docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
