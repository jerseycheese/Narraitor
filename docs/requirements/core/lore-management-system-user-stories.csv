User Story Title Summary,User Story,Priority,Estimated Complexity,Acceptance Criteria,GitHub Issue Link
Store world facts,"As a developer, I want the system to store world facts so they can be referenced consistently.",High (MVP),Medium,"New `LoreFact` objects can be created and stored in the `LoreStore`
Each fact includes an ID, content, category, and timestamps
Facts are properly indexed by their category
The system prevents duplicate fact content for the same world
Facts persist across browser sessions using IndexedDB",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/182
Categorize facts,"As a developer, I want facts categorized to better organize world knowledge.",High (MVP),Small,"Facts can be categorized into one of five types: character, location, history, item, or concept
The system maintains indexes of facts by category for quick retrieval
Categories help organize and filter facts for relevance
Category types are clearly defined with guidelines for classification
The categorization system is extensible for potential future enhancements",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/183
Ensure AI consistency,"As a player, I want the AI to remember established world details for a coherent experience.",High (MVP),Medium,"The AI consistently refers to established lore when generating content
Narrative responses reflect previously established facts
The AI avoids contradicting previously established world details
Character references maintain consistent traits and backgrounds
Location descriptions remain consistent throughout the narrative",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/184
Include lore in context,"As a developer, I want relevant lore included in AI prompts for consistent storytelling.",High (MVP),Medium,"A subset of relevant lore facts is included in AI context
Fact selection uses basic heuristics like category matching
The AI context format includes lore facts in a structured way
The system limits the number of facts to avoid exceeding context limits
The most recent or relevant facts are prioritized when space is limited",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/185
Maintain narrative consistency,"As a player, I want the narrative to maintain consistent details about the world.",High (MVP),Large,"The narrative generated by the AI reflects established world details
Character descriptions remain consistent with previous mentions
Location descriptions maintain consistency across the narrative
Historical events are referenced consistently throughout the story
World rules and concepts remain stable across sessions",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/186
Track fact sources,"As a developer, I want to trace facts back to their original sources for verification.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,"Each lore fact stores a reference to its original source
The `sourceId` field links a fact to its origin (e.g., narrative event ID)
Source references are maintained when facts are updated
The system can retrieve the original source when requested
Source tracking helps with fact verification and context",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/187
Debug lore system,"As a developer, I want access to debug tools to inspect the lore database during development.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,"DevTools allow inspection of the current `LoreStore` content
Facts can be viewed by category in the debugging interface
DevTools show which facts were included in recent AI contexts
Debugging tools provide timestamp information for facts
The tools allow basic filtering and searching of facts",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/188
Monitor lore usage,"As a developer, I want to see how lore is being used in AI contexts to improve the system.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,"DevTools track which facts are included in AI contexts
Usage frequency of facts is monitored
The system logs when facts influence AI responses
Developers can identify unused or rarely used facts
Monitoring helps optimize fact selection algorithms",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/189
