Store world facts,"As a developer, I want the system to store world facts so they can be referenced consistently.",High (MVP),Medium,"New `LoreFact` objects can be created and stored in the `LoreStore`\nEach fact includes an ID, content, category, and timestamps\nFacts are properly indexed by their category\nThe system prevents duplicate fact content for the same world\nFacts persist across browser sessions using IndexedDB",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/182,"The system must store world facts in a structured format with appropriate metadata. Facts must include unique identifiers, content, categorization, and timestamps. The system must provide efficient access to facts by category and prevent duplicate entries. Facts must persist across sessions.","Consider the balance between simplicity and flexibility in the fact storage structure. Think about how to efficiently detect duplicates while allowing for fact updates and variations. The persistence mechanism should be reliable while maintaining good performance when dealing with potentially large numbers of facts.","docs/requirements/core/lore-management-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Categorize facts,"As a developer, I want facts categorized to better organize world knowledge.",High (MVP),Small,"Facts can be categorized into one of five types: character, location, history, item, or concept\nThe system maintains indexes of facts by category for quick retrieval\nCategories help organize and filter facts for relevance\nCategory types are clearly defined with guidelines for classification\nThe categorization system is extensible for potential future enhancements",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/183,"The system must support categorizing facts into predefined types (character, location, history, item, concept). It must maintain indexes for efficient retrieval by category. The categorization system must be designed with potential future extensibility in mind.","Consider how rigid or flexible the categorization system should be. Think about edge cases where facts might belong to multiple categories. The category system should balance current needs with potential future expansion while maintaining clear classification guidelines.","docs/requirements/core/lore-management-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Ensure AI consistency,"As a player, I want the AI to remember established world details for a coherent experience.",High (MVP),Medium,"The AI consistently refers to established lore when generating content\nNarrative responses reflect previously established facts\nThe AI avoids contradicting previously established world details\nCharacter references maintain consistent traits and backgrounds\nLocation descriptions remain consistent throughout the narrative",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/184,"The system must provide established lore facts to the AI as part of its context. The AI must be instructed to reference and adhere to this lore in its responses. The system must work to prevent contradictions in AI-generated content.","Consider the balance between providing comprehensive lore and staying within context limits. Think about how to prioritize critical world facts that are most important for maintaining consistency. The prompting approach should encourage the AI to explicitly reference established facts.","docs/requirements/core/lore-management-system.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Include lore in context,"As a developer, I want relevant lore included in AI prompts for consistent storytelling.",High (MVP),Medium,"A subset of relevant lore facts is included in AI context\nFact selection uses basic heuristics like category matching\nThe AI context format includes lore facts in a structured way\nThe system limits the number of facts to avoid exceeding context limits\nThe most recent or relevant facts are prioritized when space is limited",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/185,"The system must select relevant lore facts based on the current narrative context. It must format these facts in a structured way for the AI prompt. The system must manage context size to stay within token limits and prioritize facts when space is limited.","Consider what makes a fact relevant to the current context - categories, recency, explicit mentions, etc. Think about how to format lore for maximum AI comprehension and adherence. The selection algorithm should balance comprehensive context with token efficiency.","docs/requirements/core/lore-management-system.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Maintain narrative consistency,"As a player, I want the narrative to maintain consistent details about the world.",High (MVP),Large,"The narrative generated by the AI reflects established world details\nCharacter descriptions remain consistent with previous mentions\nLocation descriptions maintain consistency across the narrative\nHistorical events are referenced consistently throughout the story\nWorld rules and concepts remain stable across sessions",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/186,"The system must ensure that narrative consistency mechanisms are robust and consistently applied. The integration between the lore system and narrative generation must work effectively to maintain world coherence.","Consider this as a holistic requirement that depends on the successful implementation of other lore-related features. The focus should be on how different systems interact to produce consistent narrative results. Regular testing with varied scenarios will help identify consistency issues.","docs/requirements/core/lore-management-system.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Track fact sources,"As a developer, I want to trace facts back to their original sources for verification.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,"Each lore fact stores a reference to its original source\nThe `sourceId` field links a fact to its origin (e.g., narrative event ID)\nSource references are maintained when facts are updated\nThe system can retrieve the original source when requested\nSource tracking helps with fact verification and context",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/187,"The system must track the origin of each lore fact by storing a reference to its source. Fact records must maintain this lineage even when updated. The system must provide a way to retrieve original sources when needed for verification.","Consider what constitutes a valid source for a fact and how to handle facts that may derive from multiple sources. Think about the information needed to trace back to the original narrative moment or input that created a fact. Source tracking should enhance debugging without adding excessive overhead.","docs/requirements/core/lore-management-system.md, docs/requirements/core/journal-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Debug lore system,"As a developer, I want access to debug tools to inspect the lore database during development.",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,"DevTools allow inspection of the current `LoreStore` content\nFacts can be viewed by category in the debugging interface\nDevTools show which facts were included in recent AI contexts\nDebugging tools provide timestamp information for facts\nThe tools allow basic filtering and searching of facts",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/188,"The system must provide debugging tools for inspecting the lore database. These tools must show facts grouped by category, display timestamps, indicate which facts were included in recent AI contexts, and support basic filtering and searching capabilities.","Consider the most useful ways to present lore information for debugging purposes. Think about what filtering and searching capabilities would be most beneficial during development.
