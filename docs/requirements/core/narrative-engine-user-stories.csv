Generate engaging narrative,"As a user, I want to read engaging narrative content that matches my selected world so I can immerse myself in the story.",High (MVP),Large,The AI Service generates narrative text that aligns with the selected world's genre and description\nGenerated content follows the basic tone inferred from world description\nThe system maintains narrative context between generated segments\nContent is engaging and encourages continued interaction\nNarrative segments are of appropriate length (neither too short nor excessively long),https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/273,"The system must integrate with an AI service to generate narrative content. It must provide world configuration data (genre, description, tone) to guide content generation. The system must maintain narrative context between generated segments and display the generated narrative appropriately.","Consider what aspects of world configuration have the most impact on narrative quality and style. Think about how to maintain continuity across multiple narrative segments. Balance between providing enough context to the AI and managing token usage efficiently. Consider how to structure prompts to encourage engaging content of appropriate length.","docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Personalize for character,"As a user, I want the narrative to acknowledge my character's attributes and skills so the story feels personalized.",High (MVP),Large,Generated narrative incorporates the active character's name throughout the story\nCharacter's primary attributes influence narrative descriptions when relevant\nCharacter's skills are acknowledged in appropriate situations\nNarrative respects character background information\nCharacter traits affect how NPCs interact with the player character,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/259,"The system must provide character information (name, attributes, skills, background) to the AI as part of the narrative context. The narrative generation process must incorporate this character information to create personalized content that acknowledges the character's unique traits.","Consider which character attributes are most narratively significant and how they should influence the story. Think about natural opportunities to reference character skills without feeling forced. The personalization should feel authentic rather than mechanical or repetitive.","docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/requirements/core/character-system.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Respect tone settings,"As a user, I want content that respects my chosen tone settings so the narrative style meets my expectations.",High (MVP),Medium,"The AI Service respects tone settings specified in the world configuration\nContent adheres to the selected content rating and maturity level\nGenerated narrative maintains a consistent tone throughout the session\nNarrative style (serious, humorous, dramatic, etc.) aligns with world settings\nLanguage complexity is appropriate for the selected world",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/245,"The system must honor tone settings specified in the world configuration. These settings must influence the style, content rating, maturity level, and language complexity of generated content. The system must maintain consistent tone throughout narrative sessions.","Consider how to effectively communicate tone preferences to the AI in a way that produces consistent results. Think about how to help users select appropriate tone settings that match their expectations. Balance tone consistency with narrative variety to maintain engagement.","docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Format narrative text,"As a user, I want properly formatted text with paragraphs and dialogue so it's easy to read.",High (MVP),Medium,Narrative text is formatted with standard paragraph breaks\nDialogue is formatted with appropriate quotation marks and attribution\nImportant elements receive proper emphasis through formatting\nText is visually organized for easy reading\nFormatting is consistent across all narrative segments,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/231,"The system must process AI-generated text to ensure proper formatting. It must handle paragraph breaks, dialogue formatting with quotation marks, and appropriate emphasis of important elements. The system must display text in a visually organized, readable manner.","Consider whether formatting should happen before or after AI generation, or both. Think about how to preserve formatting from AI output while ensuring consistency. The text display should support accessibility while maintaining good reading aesthetics.","docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Provide meaningful choices,"As a user, I want to make meaningful decisions that affect the narrative so I feel agency in the story.",High (MVP),Large,The system presents 3-4 distinct choices at appropriate narrative junctures\nEach choice offers a meaningfully different approach to the situation\nPlayer selections are recorded and tracked by the system\nChoices feel significant rather than superficial\nDecisions influence the direction of the narrative,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/217,"The system must identify appropriate points to present choices to the player. It must generate 3-4 distinct and meaningful choice options that offer different approaches to the situation. The system must record player selections and use them to influence the subsequent narrative direction.","Consider how to determine good decision points in the narrative flow. Think about what makes choices feel meaningful to players rather than superficial. Balance between choices that have immediate impact and those with long-term consequences. The choices should reflect the character's abilities and situation.","docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/requirements/core/player-decision-system.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
