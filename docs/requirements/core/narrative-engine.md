# Narrative Engine Requirements

## Overview
The Narrative Engine is the core storytelling system in NarrAItor, responsible for generating contextually appropriate narrative content, presenting choices to the player, and evolving the story based on player decisions. It integrates with AI services to create dynamic, responsive narratives that adapt to the world configuration and player character.

## Core Functionality
- **Narrative Generation**: Create world-appropriate narrative content using AI
- **Decision Points**: Present meaningful choices to the player
- **Context Management**: Maintain and update narrative context
- **History Tracking**: Record narrative events and player choices
- **Decision Impact**: Track the impact of player decisions on the narrative
- **Scene Management**: Create and transition between narrative scenes
- **Prompt Construction**: Build effective prompts for the AI service

## Data Model

```typescript
interface NarrativeState {
  currentStoryPoint: StoryPoint | null;
  visitedPoints: string[];
  availableChoices: NarrativeChoice[];
  narrativeHistory: string[];
  narrativeContext: NarrativeContext;
  selectedChoice?: string;
  currentDecision?: PlayerDecision;
  error?: NarrativeErrorInfo | null;
}

interface StoryPoint {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  type: 'scene' | 'encounter' | 'dialogue';
  significance: 'major' | 'minor';
  timestamp: number;
}

interface NarrativeChoice {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  impact?: string;
  tags: string[];
}

interface PlayerDecision {
  id: string;
  prompt: string;
  options: {
    id: string;
    text: string;
    impact?: string;
    tags: string[];
  }[];
  timestamp: number;
}

interface NarrativeContext {
  worldId: string;
  characterId: string;
  location: string;
  recentEvents: string[];
  importantDecisions: PlayerDecision[];
  toneSettings: any; // From World Configuration
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users read narrative content generated by the AI
- Users select from available choices to direct the narrative
- Users see the impact of their decisions reflected in subsequent narrative
- Users can review narrative history
- Users engage in dialogue with non-player characters
- Users navigate between different locations or scenes

## Integration Points
- **World System**: Uses world configuration to inform narrative style and content
- **Character System**: Uses character information to personalize the narrative
- **Journal System**: Records narrative events and decisions for journal entries
- **State Management**: Persists narrative state between sessions
- **AI Service**: Generates narrative content through API integration
- **Decision Tracking**: Records and references player choices

## MVP Scope Boundaries

### Included
- Basic narrative generation using AI service
- Simple player choice presentation (3-5 options)
- Essential context management for coherent storytelling
- Basic history tracking of narrative content
- Scene transitions based on player choices
- World-appropriate tone and content

### Excluded
- Complex branching narrative structures
- Advanced character relationship tracking
- Long-term narrative planning
- Multiple concurrent storylines
- Procedural quest generation
- Advanced dialogue system with NPC memory
- Narrative visualization (images, maps, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system generates coherent narrative content appropriate to the selected world
2. Player choices influence subsequent narrative development
3. The narrative respects world tone settings (family-friendly vs mature, etc.)
4. The system maintains sufficient context to create a cohesive story
5. Narrative history is recorded and accessible to the player
6. The system recovers gracefully from AI service failures
