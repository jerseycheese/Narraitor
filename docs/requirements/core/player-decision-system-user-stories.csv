Present decision points,"As a player, I want to be presented with clear decision points in the narrative so I can make meaningful choices",High (MVP),Small,The Narrative Engine generates decision points at appropriate moments in the story\nDecision points are clearly indicated as requiring player input\nThe decision prompt clearly describes the situation requiring a choice\nDecision points are visually distinct from narrative text\nDecision presentation does not disrupt narrative flow,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/248,"The system must identify appropriate moments in the narrative to present decision points. These decision points must clearly indicate that player input is required. The system must present the decision context and options in a visually distinct way from the narrative text while maintaining narrative flow","Consider how to make decision points feel like natural parts of the narrative rather than forced interruptions. Think about visual and interactive elements that clearly indicate a choice is required without disrupting immersion.

Options must be meaningful, balanced, and clearly convey the intent of each choice without obvious right or wrong answers","Consider how to generate options that genuinely reflect different personality traits or approaches. Think about the balance between options that have immediate narrative impact and those with longer-term consequences.

Records must include identifiers for the decision and selected option, timestamp information, and association with the player's character. Choice history must persist between sessions and be maintained throughout the game experience","Consider what choice data is most useful for influencing future narrative. Think about the persistence mechanism that balances reliability with performance.

Include decisions in journal,"As a player, I want to see my major decisions in my journal so I can remember what choices I've made",High (MVP),Small,Major decisions are recorded as entries in the Journal System\nJournal entries reference both the decision prompt and chosen option\nDecision entries are categorized appropriately in the journal\nJournal entries include decision context (when and where)\nJournal decision entries are formatted consistently with other entries,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/208,"The system must record major decisions in the journal system. Journal entries must include both the decision context and the player's choice. Entries must be properly categorized and include relevant contextual information such as time and location. Decision entries must be consistently formatted with other journal entries","Consider what constitutes a 'major' decision worthy of journal entry versus minor choices that might create clutter. Think about how to format decision entries to highlight both the situation and the player's response.
