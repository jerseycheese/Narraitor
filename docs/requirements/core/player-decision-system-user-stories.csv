Present decision points,"As a player, I want to be presented with clear decision points in the narrative so I can make meaningful choices.",High (MVP),Small,The Narrative Engine generates decision points at appropriate moments in the story\nDecision points are clearly indicated as requiring player input\nThe decision prompt clearly describes the situation requiring a choice\nDecision points are visually distinct from narrative text\nDecision presentation does not disrupt narrative flow,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/248,"The system must identify appropriate moments in the narrative to present decision points. These decision points must clearly indicate that player input is required. The system must present the decision context and options in a visually distinct way from the narrative text while maintaining narrative flow.","Consider how to make decision points feel like natural parts of the narrative rather than forced interruptions. Think about visual and interactive elements that clearly indicate a choice is required without disrupting immersion. The transition between narrative and decision points should be smooth.","docs/requirements/core/player-decision-system.md, docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Provide multiple options,"As a player, I want multiple options for each decision so I can express my character's personality.",High (MVP),Small,"Each decision provides 3-4 distinct options representing different approaches\nOptions reflect different character traits or motivations\nOptions are varied enough to feel like meaningful choices\nOption text clearly conveys the intent of each choice\nOptions are balanced to avoid obviously ""right"" or ""wrong"" choices",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/234,"The system must generate 3-4 distinct decision options for each decision point. These options must represent different approaches or character traits. Options must be meaningful, balanced, and clearly convey the intent of each choice without obvious right or wrong answers.","Consider how to generate options that genuinely reflect different personality traits or approaches. Think about the balance between options that have immediate narrative impact and those with longer-term consequences. Options should be distinct without being completely disconnected from each other.","docs/requirements/core/player-decision-system.md, docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Create usable interface,"As a player, I want a clean, readable interface for decisions so I can easily understand my options.",High (MVP),Small,Each decision option is presented clearly in the UI\nDecision options are visually distinct from each other\nThe interface is responsive on different screen sizes\nDecision text is readable with appropriate font size and contrast\nThe selected option is clearly indicated when chosen,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/220,"The system must present decision options in a clean, readable interface. Options must be visually distinct from each other. The interface must be responsive across different screen sizes. Text must be readable with appropriate font size and contrast. The system must clearly indicate which option is selected after a choice is made.","Consider the visual design of decision options to balance readability with aesthetic appeal. Think about how the interface should respond to different screen sizes and orientations. The feedback when selecting an option should be immediate and clear while maintaining the narrative atmosphere.","docs/requirements/core/player-decision-system.md, docs/requirements/ui/game-session.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Record player choices,"As a player, I want my choices to be recorded so they can influence the narrative going forward.",High (MVP),Small,"When a player selects an option, a complete record is created and stored\nThe record includes decision ID, option ID, and timestamp\nChoice records persist between browser sessions\nThe system correctly associates choices with the player's character\nChoice history is maintained throughout the game experience",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/206,"The system must record player choice data when a decision is made. Records must include identifiers for the decision and selected option, timestamp information, and association with the player's character. Choice history must persist between sessions and be maintained throughout the game experience.","Consider what choice data is most useful for influencing future narrative. Think about the persistence mechanism that balances reliability with performance. The choice recording system should be unobtrusive to the player while capturing all relevant information for narrative continuity.","docs/requirements/core/player-decision-system.md, docs/requirements/core/character-system.md, docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Include decisions in journal,"As a player, I want to see my major decisions in my journal so I can remember what choices I've made.",High (MVP),Small,Major decisions are recorded as entries in the Journal System\nJournal entries reference both the decision prompt and chosen option\nDecision entries are categorized appropriately in the journal\nJournal entries include decision context (when and where)\nJournal decision entries are formatted consistently with other entries,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/192,"The system must record major decisions in the journal system. Journal entries must include both the decision context and the player's choice. Entries must be properly categorized and include relevant contextual information such as time and location. Decision entries must be consistently formatted with other journal entries.","Consider what constitutes a 'major' decision worthy of journal entry versus minor choices that might create clutter. Think about how to format decision entries to highlight both the situation and the player's response. The journal presentation should help players recall their narrative journey.","docs/requirements/core/player-decision-system.md, docs/requirements/core/journal-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
