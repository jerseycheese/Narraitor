# Player Decision System Requirements

## Overview
The Player Decision System is responsible for creating, presenting, tracking, and recording player choices throughout the narrative experience. This system ensures that player decisions have meaningful impact and persistence across game sessions, contributing to a personalized narrative experience.

## Core Functionality
- **Decision Generation**: Create contextually relevant decision points in narrative
- **Decision Presentation**: Display choices to players with basic descriptions
- **Decision Recording**: Store player choices with metadata
- **Decision History**: Maintain a history of past decisions
- **Impact Tracking**: Record basic consequences of decisions
- **Decision Metadata**: Store essential context information (location, timestamp)

## Data Model

```typescript
interface PlayerDecision {
  id: string;
  prompt: string;
  options: DecisionOption[];
  timestamp: number;
  location?: string;
  tags: string[];
}

interface DecisionOption {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  tags: string[];
}

interface PlayerChoice {
  decisionId: string;
  optionId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  consequence?: string;
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users view decision prompts with multiple options
- Users select from available decision options
- Users experience narrative consequences of past decisions
- Users can review major decisions through the journal system

## Integration Points
- **Narrative Engine**: Coordinates decision points within narrative flow
- **Character System**: Reflects basic decision impacts on character
- **Journal System**: Records decisions in journal entries
- **World System**: Provides context for decisions based on world settings
- **AI Service**: Generates contextually appropriate decisions

## MVP Scope Boundaries

- Straightforward impact on subsequent narrative
- DevTools integration to expose helpful info/debug tools

- Detailed impact descriptions for decision options
- Visual representation of decision impacts
- Advanced impact simulation across multiple dimensions
- Decision undo/revision functionality

- Character relationship impact tracking
- Advanced filtering of decision history
- Decision outcome statistics
- Decision flowcharts or visualization
- Multiple decision styles or presentation options

- Decision timers or time-limited choices

## User Stories

1. **Decision Presentation**
- As a player, I want to be presented with clear decision points in the narrative so I can make meaningful choices

  ## Priority
  - [x] High (MVP)
  - [ ] Medium (MVP Enhancement)
  - [ ] Low (Nice to Have)
  - [ ] Post-MVP

  ## Estimated Complexity
  - [ ] Small
  - [x] Medium
  - [ ] Large

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The Narrative Engine generates decision points with 3-4 distinct options relevant to the current narrative context.

- As a player, I want multiple options for each decision so I can express my character's personality

  ## Priority
  - [x] High (MVP)
  - [ ] Medium (MVP Enhancement)
  - [ ] Low (Nice to Have)
  - [ ] Post-MVP

  ## Estimated Complexity
  - [ ] Small
  - [x] Medium
  - [ ] Large

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. Each decision provides at least 3 distinct options representing different approaches or attitudes.
  2. Options reflect different character traits or motivations when appropriate.

- As a player, I want a clean, readable interface for decisions so I can easily understand my options

  ## Priority
  - [x] High (MVP)
  - [ ] Medium (MVP Enhancement)
  - [ ] Low (Nice to Have)
  - [ ] Post-MVP

  ## Estimated Complexity
  - [ ] Small
  - [x] Medium
  - [ ] Large

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. Each decision option is presented clearly in the UI (e.g., as a button or list item).
  2. The UI is responsive and displays choices clearly on different screen sizes.

2. **Decision Recording**
- As a player, I want my choices to be recorded so they can influence the narrative going forward

  ## Priority
  - [x] High (MVP)
  - [ ] Medium (MVP Enhancement)
  - [ ] Low (Nice to Have)
  - [ ] Post-MVP

  ## Estimated Complexity
  - [ ] Small
  - [x] Medium
  - [ ] Large

  **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. When a player selects an option, a `PlayerChoice` record is created containing the `decisionId`, `optionId`, and `timestamp`.
  2. The `PlayerChoice` record is stored persistently (e.g., via State Management).

- As a player, I want to see my major decisions in my journal so I can remember what choices I've made

  ## Priority
