Create new campaign,"As a player, I want to create a new campaign with a selected world and character so I can start a new story.",High (MVP),Medium,"Users can initiate the creation of a new campaign from the main interface\nThe system allows selection of a world and character for the campaign\nCampaign creation stores basic metadata (name, world, character, creation date)\nThe new campaign appears in the campaign list immediately after creation\nUsers can begin play immediately after creating a campaign",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/275,"The system must provide an interface for campaign creation. It must allow users to select from existing worlds and characters. The system must store campaign metadata (name, world, character, creation date) and display the new campaign in the campaign list immediately after creation.","Consider the most intuitive flow for creating a new campaign. Think about what information is essential at creation time versus what could be set later. The interface should guide users through the process while preventing errors like creating campaigns without required elements.","docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/core/character-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Continue existing campaign,"As a player, I want to continue an existing campaign so I can resume my story where I left off.",High (MVP),Medium,"Existing campaigns are listed with basic metadata (name, world, character, last played)\nUsers can select a campaign to load its complete state\nThe system restores all state components (narrative, journal, character) correctly\nCampaign state loads without significant delay\nPlay resumes from exactly where the user left off",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/261,"The system must display a list of existing campaigns with relevant metadata. It must load the complete state of a selected campaign, including all components (narrative, journal, character) to allow resuming play exactly where the user left off. State restoration must be reliable and perform without significant delay.","Consider how to present campaigns in a way that helps users identify the one they want to continue. Think about the loading experience and potential feedback during state restoration. The system should handle edge cases like corrupted save data or missing components gracefully.","docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/core/character-system.md, docs/requirements/core/narrative-engine.md, docs/requirements/core/journal-system.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Delete unwanted campaigns,"As a player, I want to delete campaigns I'm no longer interested in so I can keep my campaign list organized.",High (MVP),Small,Users can initiate deletion of a campaign from the campaign list\nThe system requires confirmation before deleting a campaign\nDeleted campaigns are completely removed from storage\nThe campaign list updates immediately after deletion\nDeletion is permanent and cannot be undone,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/247,"The system must allow users to delete campaigns they no longer want. It must require confirmation before completing deletion to prevent accidental data loss. The system must remove all campaign data including associated content (narrative sessions, journal entries, etc.) from storage.","Consider the appropriate level of warning for a permanent deletion action. Think about the user flow to minimize accidental deletions while keeping the process straightforward. The system should provide clear feedback after deletion is complete.","docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Auto-save game state,"As a player, I want my game state to automatically save during play so I don't lose progress if my browser crashes.",High (MVP),Medium,The application state saves automatically every 5 minutes during active gameplay\nState saves after significant events like player decisions or scene changes\nAuto-save occurs without disrupting the player experience\nSave operations properly handle large state objects\nThe system tracks the timestamp of the last successful save,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/233,"The system must automatically save game state periodically and after significant events. Auto-save operations must not disrupt gameplay. The system must handle large state objects efficiently and track when saves occur. Save operations must be robust against errors.","Consider the balance between save frequency and performance impact. Think about which events should trigger immediate saves. The save process should be optimized to handle varying sizes of state data without causing noticeable interruptions to the player experience.","docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
Show save notifications,"As a player, I want to be notified when my game is saved so I know my progress is secure.",High (MVP),Small,"A visual indicator confirms successful save operations\nSave notifications are subtle and non-disruptive\nNotifications appear briefly and disappear automatically\nNotifications include basic information (e.g., ""Game saved at 2:45 PM"")\nNotification styling matches the game's aesthetic",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/219,"The system must provide visual confirmation when game state is successfully saved. These notifications must be subtle and non-disruptive to gameplay. They must appear briefly, include basic save information, and automatically disappear after a short time.","Consider where and how save notifications should appear to be visible without being distracting. Think about appropriate timing for notification display and disappearance. The visual design should complement the game's aesthetic while clearly conveying the save status.","docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/requirements/ui/game-session.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md",N/A
