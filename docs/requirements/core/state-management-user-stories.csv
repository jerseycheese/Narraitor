Create new campaign,"As a player, I want to create a new campaign with a selected world and character so I can start a new story",High (MVP),Medium,"Users can initiate the creation of a new campaign from the main interface\nThe system allows selection of a world and character for the campaign\nCampaign creation stores basic metadata (name, world, character, creation date)\nThe new campaign appears in the campaign list immediately after creation\nUsers can begin play immediately after creating a campaign",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/214,"The system must provide an interface for campaign creation. It must allow users to select from existing worlds and characters. The system must store campaign metadata (name, world, character, creation date) and display the new campaign in the campaign list immediately after creation","Consider the most intuitive flow for creating a new campaign.
