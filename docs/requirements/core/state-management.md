# State Management Requirements

## Overview
The State Management system handles the persistence, retrieval, and organization of game state data across all NarrAItor systems. It provides a unified approach to state manipulation with domain-specific reducers, type-safe operations, and reliable storage using IndexedDB.

## Core Functionality
- **State Storage**: Persist application state between sessions
- **State Retrieval**: Load saved state when resuming sessions
- **Domain-Specific Reducers**: Manage state updates for each domain
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Ensure data integrity through strong typing
- **Campaign Management**: Support multiple independent game campaigns
- **Import/Export**: Enable backup and sharing of game data
- **Error Recovery**: Handle storage failures gracefully

## Data Model

```typescript
interface AppState {
  worlds: WorldState;
  characters: CharacterState;
  narrative: NarrativeState;
  journal: JournalState;
  ui: UIState;
  session: SessionState;
}

interface SessionState {
  activeWorldId: string | null;
  activeCharacterId: string | null;
  activeCampaignId: string | null;
  campaigns: Record<string, Campaign>;
  lastSaved: number;
}

interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  worldId: string;
  characterId: string;
  createdAt: number;
  lastPlayedAt: number;
}

// State management actions follow a standard pattern
type Action<T extends string, P = void> = P extends void
  ? { type: T }
  : { type: T; payload: P };
```

## User Interactions
- Users create new campaigns or continue existing ones
- Users save their game progress manually
- Users benefit from automatic saving at key points
- Users import and export game data
- Users delete unwanted campaigns
- Users navigate between multiple campaigns

## Integration Points
- **World System**: Manages world configuration state
- **Character System**: Manages character data state
- **Narrative Engine**: Manages narrative progression state
- **Journal System**: Manages journal entry state
- **UI Components**: Consume state via hooks and context

## MVP Scope Boundaries

### Included
- Domain-specific reducers for each core system
- IndexedDB persistence layer
- Automatic saving at key game points
- Basic campaign management
- Simple import/export functionality
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Type-safe state operations

### Excluded
- Cloud synchronization
- Advanced versioning system
- Shared campaigns between devices
- Complex state migration tools
- State conflict resolution
- Detailed change history
- State compression for large datasets

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Game state persists correctly between browser sessions
2. Players can manage multiple distinct campaigns
3. State operations maintain type safety and data integrity
4. The system handles storage failures gracefully
5. Players can import and export their game data
6. Automatic saving occurs at appropriate intervals
7. State retrievals perform efficiently without blocking UI
