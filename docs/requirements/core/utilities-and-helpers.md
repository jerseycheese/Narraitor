# Utilities and Helpers Requirements

## Overview
The Utilities and Helpers module provides a collection of reusable functions, tools, and utilities that support various core systems across Narraitor. These utilities handle common operations, provide type safety, manage errors, and support development workflows.

## Core Functionality
- **Error Handling**: Create standardized error objects with consistent structure
- **Type Guards**: TypeScript utility functions for type narrowing and validation
- **UUID Generation**: Create unique identifiers for various entities
- **Text Processing**: Clean, normalize, and format AI-generated content
- **Debug Utilities**: Logging and debugging tools for development
- **Storage Utilities**: IndexedDB persistence helpers for local storage
- **Retry Logic**: Manage retries for asynchronous operations
- **Context Optimization**: Utilities for optimizing AI context and token management

## Utility Categories

### Core Utilities
- **Error Utils**: Standardized error creation with metadata and error classification
- **Type Guards**: TypeScript type verification for domain objects
- **UUID Generator**: Browser-compatible unique ID generation
- **Text Cleaning**: Normalize and clean AI-generated content
- **Debug Logger**: Development-focused logging with severity levels

### Storage Utilities
- **IndexedDB Wrapper**: Type-safe storage access with error handling
- **State Operations**: Safe state manipulation helpers
- **Property Extraction**: Safely access nested properties in state objects
- **Storage Migration**: Basic version handling for local storage

### AI Utilities
- **Prompt Utils**: Helper functions for prompt construction
- **Retry Logic**: Handle AI service call failures with backoff
- **Context Management**: Token counting and context optimization
- **Response Cleaning**: Remove metadata from AI responses
- **Response Validation**: Basic sanity checks for AI responses

### Development Utilities
- **Debug Console**: Development-only logging interface with severity levels
- **Performance Tracking**: Measure critical operations and component renders
- **Error Reporting**: Format and categorize errors for debugging
- **Fallback Content**: Utilities for providing content when AI fails
- **State Inspection**: Tools for examining application state
- **Window API**: Global access to debugging functions via window object

## Integration Points
- **AI Service**: Use error handling, retry logic, and text processing utilities
- **State Management**: Leverage storage utilities and state helpers
- **UI Components**: Utilize debug tools and error formatting
- **Game Logic**: Employ text processing and content normalization
- **DevTools**: Provide utility functions for the DevTools component

## Related Systems
For a comprehensive development environment, these utilities work in conjunction with the **DevTools** system which provides a UI-based debugging interface. While these utilities provide programmatic functions that can be used throughout the application, the DevTools system provides a user interface for debugging and testing. See [DevTools Requirements](./devtools.md) for more information.

## User Stories
For detailed user stories, please see the [Utilities and Helpers User Stories CSV file](./utilities-and-helpers-user-stories.csv).

## Implementation Approach
1. Create a centralized error handling system first
2. Implement the storage layer with proper error handling
3. Build general utilities (UUID, type guards, formatting)
4. Develop the debugging infrastructure 
5. Create the window-accessible debugging API
6. Implement text processing utilities
7. Build specialized AI service utilities
8. Add state inspection and manipulation helpers
9. Ensure all utilities have proper TypeScript definitions
10. Add comprehensive unit tests for all utility functions
