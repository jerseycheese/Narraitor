# Utilities and Helpers Requirements

## Overview
The Utilities and Helpers module provides a collection of reusable functions, tools, and utilities that support various core systems across Narraitor. These utilities handle common operations, provide type safety, manage errors, and support development workflows.

## Core Functionality
- **Error Handling**: Create standardized error objects with consistent structure
- **Type Guards**: TypeScript utility functions for type narrowing and validation
- **UUID Generation**: Create unique identifiers for various entities
- **Text Processing**: Clean, normalize, and format AI-generated content
- **Debug Utilities**: Logging and debugging tools for development
- **Storage Utilities**: IndexedDB persistence helpers for local storage
- **Retry Logic**: Manage retries for asynchronous operations
- **Context Optimization**: Utilities for optimizing AI context and token management

## Utility Categories

### Core Utilities
- **Error Utils**: Standardized error creation with metadata and error classification
- **Type Guards**: TypeScript type verification for domain objects
- **UUID Generator**: Browser-compatible unique ID generation
- **Text Cleaning**: Normalize and clean AI-generated content
- **Debug Logger**: Development-focused logging with severity levels

### Storage Utilities
- **IndexedDB Wrapper**: Type-safe storage access with error handling
- **State Operations**: Safe state manipulation helpers
- **Property Extraction**: Safely access nested properties in state objects
- **Storage Migration**: Basic version handling for local storage

### AI Utilities
- **Prompt Utils**: Helper functions for prompt construction
- **Retry Logic**: Handle AI service call failures with backoff
- **Context Management**: Token counting and context optimization
- **Response Cleaning**: Remove metadata from AI responses
- **Response Validation**: Basic sanity checks for AI responses

### Development Utilities
- **Debug Console**: Development-only logging interface with severity levels
- **Performance Tracking**: Measure critical operations and component renders
- **Error Reporting**: Format and categorize errors for debugging
- **Fallback Content**: Utilities for providing content when AI fails
- **State Inspection**: Tools for examining application state
- **Window API**: Global access to debugging functions via window object

## Integration Points
- **AI Service**: Use error handling, retry logic, and text processing utilities
- **State Management**: Leverage storage utilities and state helpers
- **UI Components**: Utilize debug tools and error formatting
- **Game Logic**: Employ text processing and content normalization
- **DevTools**: Provide utility functions for the DevTools component

## Related Systems
For a comprehensive development environment, these utilities work in conjunction with the **DevTools** system which provides a UI-based debugging interface. While these utilities provide programmatic functions that can be used throughout the application, the DevTools system provides a user interface for debugging and testing. See [DevTools Requirements](./devtools.md) for more information.
