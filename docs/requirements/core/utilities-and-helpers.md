# Utilities and Helpers Requirements

## Overview
The Utilities and Helpers module provides a collection of reusable functions, tools, and utilities that support various core systems across NarrAItor. These utilities handle common operations, provide type safety, manage errors, and support development workflows.

## Core Functionality
- **Error Handling**: Create and manage error objects with consistent structure
- **Type Guards**: TypeScript utility functions for type narrowing and validation
- **UUID Generation**: Create unique identifiers for various entities
- **Text Processing**: Clean, normalize, and format text content
- **Debug Utilities**: Logging and debugging tools for development
- **State Utilities**: Common helper functions for state manipulation
- **Retry Logic**: Manage retries for asynchronous operations
- **Context Optimization**: Utilities for optimizing AI context

## Utility Categories

### Core Utilities
- **Error Utils**: Standard error creation and handling
- **Type Guards**: TypeScript type verification utilities
- **UUID Generator**: Consistent unique ID generation
- **Text Cleaning**: Normalize AI-generated content
- **Debug Logger**: Development logging with levels
- **State Helpers**: Common state operations

### AI Utilities
- **Prompt Utils**: Helper functions for prompt construction
- **Retry Logic**: Handle AI service call failures
- **Context Optimization**: Manage token limits effectively
- **Response Cleaning**: Normalize AI responses
- **Validation Helpers**: Validate AI-generated content

### Development Utilities
- **Test Helpers**: Support functions for testing
- **Mock Data Generators**: Create test data consistently
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track critical operations
- **Debug Console**: Interactive debugging interface

## Integration Points
- **All Core Systems**: Use these utilities throughout the application
- **State Management**: Leverage state utilities
- **AI Service**: Use AI-specific utilities and helpers
- **Testing Framework**: Incorporate test utilities

## MVP Scope Boundaries
