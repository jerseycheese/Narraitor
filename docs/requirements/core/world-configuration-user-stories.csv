Create world from description,"As a user, I want to create a new world by describing it in my own words so I can quickly set up a custom narrative setting.",High (MVP),Medium,"The system accepts and processes a freeform text description of a fictional world\nThe system guides the user through a step-by-step world creation process\nThe user can enter basic world information including name, description, and genre\nForm validation ensures required information is provided\nCreated worlds are saved to the system for future use",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/282,"The system must provide an interface for users to create new worlds using freeform text descriptions. It must guide users through a structured creation process while capturing essential world information. The system must validate user inputs and save created worlds for future use.","Consider the balance between structure and freedom in the world creation process. Think about what information is essential for world creation versus what can be added later. The interface should make world creation approachable for users without requiring game design expertise.","docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Generate AI suggestions,"As a user, I want AI to suggest appropriate attributes and skills based on my world description so I don't have to design everything from scratch.",High (MVP),Large,The AI Service analyzes the provided world description\nThe system suggests appropriate attributes and skills based on the analysis\nThe user receives clear feedback during AI processing\nAI suggestions include appropriate names and descriptions for attributes and skills\nSuggestions are contextually relevant to the described world,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/305,"The system must leverage AI capabilities to analyze user-provided world descriptions and suggest appropriate attributes and skills. It must present these suggestions in a usable format and provide clear feedback during processing. Suggestions must include names and descriptions that are contextually relevant to the described world.","Consider how to structure AI prompts to generate the most relevant attribute and skill suggestions. Think about the appropriate level of detail for suggestions and how they should be presented to users. The system should handle AI processing delays gracefully with informative feedback.","docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/integrations/ai-service.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Use predefined templates,"As a user, I want to select a pre-defined template to quickly set up a world if I don't want to create my own.",High (MVP),Small,"Pre-defined templates for Western, Sitcom, and Fantasy genres are available\nTemplates include complete sets of appropriate attributes and skills\nUsers can select and customize a template as an alternative to AI-assisted creation\nSelected templates pre-populate all required world configuration fields\nTemplate selections are clearly presented as options during world creation",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/182,"The system must provide pre-defined world templates for common genres. These templates must include complete sets of appropriate attributes and skills. The system must allow users to select and customize these templates as an alternative to AI-assisted creation. Selected templates must pre-populate all required configuration fields.","Consider what genres would be most useful to provide as templates for users. Think about how to present templates in an appealing way that communicates their themes. The template system should provide a good starting point while still encouraging customization.","docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Review attribute suggestions,"As a user, I want to review and modify AI-suggested attributes for my world so I can customize them to my preferences.",High (MVP),Medium,"The UI displays AI-suggested attributes clearly\nUsers can approve, modify, or reject each suggested attribute\nModified attributes are immediately updated in the UI\nChanges persist between wizard steps\nThe interface provides clear feedback on user actions",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/229,"The system must display AI-suggested attributes in a clear, reviewable format. It must allow users to approve, modify, or reject individual attribute suggestions. The system must update the UI immediately when attributes are modified and persist these changes between steps of the creation process.","Consider how to present attribute suggestions in a way that balances comprehensiveness with usability. Think about what modifications users are most likely to make to suggestions and how to make those edits intuitive. The interface should provide clear feedback on what's been approved, modified, or rejected.","docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
Define custom attributes,"As a user, I want to define custom attributes for my world so characters can have appropriate traits.",High (MVP),Medium,Users can add new custom attributes beyond AI suggestions\nThe system enforces the MVP limit of 6 total attributes\nEach attribute requires a name and description\nDuplicate attribute names are prevented through validation\nCustom attributes are saved with the world configuration",https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/230,"The system must allow users to define their own custom attributes beyond AI suggestions. It must enforce the MVP limit of 6 total attributes while requiring essential information for each attribute. The system must validate inputs to prevent duplicates and save custom attributes with the world configuration.","Consider how to guide users in creating meaningful attributes without overwhelming them with options. Think about the appropriate constraints on attribute creation to ensure gameplay balance. The interface should make it clear how many attributes can still be added within the limit.","docs/requirements/core/world-configuration.md, docs/requirements/core/state-management.md, docs/workflows/user-story-workflow.md, docs/workflows/user-story-template.md"
