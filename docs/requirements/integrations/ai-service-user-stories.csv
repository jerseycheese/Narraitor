Generate AI responses,"As a user, I want the AI to generate narrative content based on my world and character so I can enjoy a personalized story",High (MVP),Large,Generated narrative content references specific player's world and character details\nThe AI maintains consistent tone and style appropriate to the world genre\nNarrative elements respect and build upon previously established story elements\nThe system filters out inappropriate content based on safety settings\nNarrative segments are of appropriate length for optimal readability,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/303
Create decision options,"As a user, I want the AI to create meaningful decision options so I can direct the narrative",High (MVP),Medium,The AI generates distinct choice options at appropriate narrative junctures\nOptions reflect meaningfully different possible narrative directions\nOptions consider the player character's attributes and previous choices\nOptions are formatted consistently for UI presentation\nOptions include choices related to character strengths and weaknesses,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/304
Get character assistance,"As a user, I want the AI to provide character development assistance so I can create rich characters",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Medium,The AI suggests appropriate attributes and skills based on character concepts\nCharacter description suggestions are provided when requested\nSuggestions align with the selected world's theme and genre\nThe system provides an interface for users to manage AI suggestions\nThe AI provides character background elements that create potential story hooks,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/305
Format AI responses,"As a user, I want AI responses to be appropriately formatted for display so they're easy to read",High (MVP),Small,Generated text has proper paragraph breaks and consistent formatting\nDialogue is clearly distinguished using quotation marks when applicable\nResponse content is cleaned of any formatting artifacts\nText is presented with appropriate emphasis for important elements\nContent formatting is responsive across different screen sizes,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/306
Restart generation,"As a user, I want the option to restart generation if I'm unhappy with the results",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,A clearly visible regenerate option is available after content is displayed\nThe regeneration request uses the same context but varies parameters\nUsers can regenerate a limited number of times to prevent API abuse\nUsers are given feedback during the regeneration process\nThe system logs regeneration requests to identify content that needs improvement,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/302
Use fallback content,"As a user, I want to continue playing with fallback content if the AI service is unavailable so my experience isn't interrupted",High (MVP),Medium,The system provides context-appropriate fallback content when AI is unavailable\nFallback content is clearly indicated to the user\nFallback content maintains narrative coherence with previous content\nThe system automatically reverts to AI generation when the service becomes available\nThe system maintains diverse fallback content options for different situations,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/301
Retry failed requests,"As a user, I want the system to automatically retry failed requests so temporary issues are resolved without intervention",High (MVP),Medium,The system automatically retries identified transient errors\nRetries implement exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming the API\nThe UI shows appropriate loading indicators during retries\nNon-retryable errors are immediately reported without retry attempts\nA comprehensive error classification system identifies which errors should be retried,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/300
See friendly errors,"As a user, I want to see friendly error messages when AI requests fail so I understand what happened",High (MVP),Small,Technical API errors are translated into user-friendly messages\nError messages suggest possible actions for resolution when appropriate\nErrors are displayed in the UI as non-intrusive notifications\nDifferent error types have distinct appropriate messages\nError messages are displayed promptly after error detection,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/299
Include examples in prompts,"As a developer, I want to include examples in prompts to guide the AI's responses",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Small,Prompt templates support including optional examples\nExamples demonstrate the desired output format and style\nExamples are context-appropriate for the specific prompt type\nExamples are included only when they add value within token constraints\nThe system allows developers to manage the example library,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/298
Optimize token usage,"As a developer, I want to optimize prompts for token efficiency so we maximize API usage",Medium (MVP Enhancement),Medium,The system accurately estimates token counts for prompts before sending requests\nContext is truncated when it exceeds token limits with clear logging\nRecent and important content is prioritized in context optimization\nThe system uses prompt compression techniques to maximize information\nThe system provides metrics on token usage efficiency,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/297
Include context in prompts,"As a developer, I want to include world and character context in prompts so the AI has relevant information",High (MVP),Medium,Prompts include relevant world information (genre description key locations)\nCharacter information is incorporated when appropriate\nThe context is formatted in a structured way that the AI can effectively use\nThe system prioritizes the most relevant context when space is limited\nThe context information is automatically updated when details change,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/296
Define prompt templates,"As a developer, I want to define effective prompt templates for different use cases so the AI generates appropriate content",High (MVP),Medium,The system implements a template system supporting different prompt types\nEach template allows for variable substitution using a standardized syntax\nTemplates include appropriate instructions for the AI based on their purpose\nTemplates can be organized and retrieved by their use case type\nTemplates can be validated to ensure they contain required elements,https://github.com/jerseycheese/Narraitor/issues/295
