# AI Service Integration Requirements

## Overview
The AI Service Integration system provides a unified interface for interacting with AI models that power NarrAItor's narrative generation, character assistance, and decision management. It handles API communication, prompt construction, response processing, and error management for all AI-dependent features.

## Core Functionality
- **API Communication**: Interface with Google Gemini or alternative AI models
- **Prompt Construction**: Build effective prompts for different use cases
- **Response Processing**: Parse and normalize AI responses
- **Context Management**: Optimize context for token efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Manage API failures with appropriate recovery
- **Service Configuration**: Allow configuration of AI service parameters
- **Fallback Systems**: Provide alternatives when AI service is unavailable

## Data Model

```typescript
interface AIServiceConfig {
  modelName: string;
  apiKey: string;
  endpoint: string;
  maxRetries: number;
  timeout: number;
  temperatureSettings: {
    narrative: number;
    decisions: number;
    summaries: number;
  };
}

interface AIRequest {
  requestId: string;
  prompt: string;
  context?: string;
  temperature?: number;
  maxTokens?: number;
  requestType: 'narrative' | 'decision' | 'summary' | 'character';
  timestamp: number;
}

interface AIResponse {
  requestId: string;
  content: string;
  usage?: {
    promptTokens: number;
    completionTokens: number;
    totalTokens: number;
  };
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    retryable: boolean;
  };
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users interact indirectly via narrative and character features
- Users may see loading indicators during API requests
- Users receive error messages for non-recoverable failures
- Users can optionally configure AI service settings (advanced)

## Integration Points
- **Narrative Engine**: Provides narrative generation capabilities
- **Character System**: Supports character creation and development
- **Journal System**: Generates summaries for journal entries
- **World System**: Uses world configuration to influence prompts
- **State Management**: Persists configuration between sessions

## MVP Scope Boundaries

### Included
- Google Gemini integration (primary)
- Basic prompt templates for narrative and decisions
- Essential error handling and retries
- Simple response parsing
- Context optimization for token efficiency
- Fallback content for essential features
- Configurable service parameters

### Excluded
- Multi-model provider support
- Advanced prompt engineering interface
- Streaming responses
- Complex prompt chaining
- Detailed metrics tracking
- Image generation (except simple character portraits)
- Fine-tuning capabilities
- Model preference learning

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system successfully communicates with the Google Gemini API
2. Prompts are constructed effectively for different use cases
3. Responses are parsed correctly and normalized for application use
4. The system handles API errors gracefully with appropriate retries
5. Context is optimized to stay within token limits
6. Fallback content is provided when AI service is unavailable
7. Service configuration persists between sessions
