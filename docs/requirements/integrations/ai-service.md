# AI Service Integration Requirements

## Overview
The AI Service Integration system provides a unified interface for interacting with AI models that power NarrAItor's narrative generation, character assistance, and decision management. It handles API communication, prompt construction, response processing, and error management for all AI-dependent features.

## Core Functionality
- **API Communication**: Interface with Google Gemini or alternative AI models
- **Prompt Construction**: Build effective prompts for different use cases
- **Response Processing**: Parse and normalize AI responses
- **Context Management**: Optimize context for token efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Manage API failures with appropriate recovery
- **Service Configuration**: Allow configuration of AI service parameters
- **Fallback Systems**: Provide alternatives when AI service is unavailable
- **Content Safety**: Filter inappropriate content from responses
- **Response Caching**: Cache identical requests to reduce API usage
- **Request Logging**: Log API requests and responses for debugging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and success rates
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Monitor and manage API token consumption
- **Service Health Checks**: Verify API availability before making requests

## Data Model

```typescript
interface AIServiceConfig {
  provider: 'google' | 'openai' | 'anthropic';
  modelName: string;
  apiKey: string;
  endpoint: string;
  maxRetries: number;
  timeout: number;
  temperatureSettings: {
    narrative: number;
    decisions: number;
    summaries: number;
    character: number;
    dialogue: number;
    description: number;
  };
  maxOutputTokens: {
    narrative: number;
    decisions: number;
    summaries: number;
    character: number;
    dialogue: number;

    contentFilters: string[];
  };

}

  maxTokens?: number;
  requestType: 'narrative' | 'decision' | 'summary' | 'character' | 'dialogue' | 'description';
  timestamp: number;
  priority?: 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';

}

interface AIResponse {
  requestId: string;
  content: string;
  usage?: {
    promptTokens: number;
    completionTokens: number;
    totalTokens: number;
  };
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    retryable: boolean;
    details?: string;
  };
  responseTime?: number;
  source: 'api' | 'cache' | 'fallback';
  timestamp: number;
  safetyFilterApplied?: boolean;
  formattedContent?: string;
}

interface PromptTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  template: string;
  description: string;
  useCase: 'narrative' | 'decision' | 'summary' | 'character' | 'dialogue' | 'description';
  requiredVariables: string[];
  optionalVariables: string[];
  examples?: string[];
  worldSpecific?: boolean;
  tokensEstimate?: number;
}

interface ServiceStatistics {
  requestsTotal: number;
  requestsSucceeded: number;
  requestsFailed: number;
  averageResponseTime: number;
  tokenUsage: {
    promptTokens: number;
    completionTokens: number;
    totalTokens: number;
  };
  cacheHitRate?: number;
  errorsByType: Record<string, number>;
}
```

## User Interactions
- Users interact indirectly via narrative and character features
- Users see loading indicators during API requests
- Users receive error messages for non-recoverable failures
- Users can configure basic AI service settings via settings page
- Users can view token usage statistics (post-MVP)
- Users can provide feedback on AI-generated content (post-MVP)
- Users can restart a generation if they're unsatisfied with results

## Integration Points
- **Narrative Engine**: Provides narrative generation capabilities
- **Character System**: Supports character creation and development
- **Journal System**: Generates summaries for journal entries
- **World System**: Uses world configuration to influence prompts
- **State Management**: Persists configuration between sessions
- **Game Session UI**: Shows loading states and error messages
- **Debug Tools**: Provides monitoring and diagnostics
