# Work Progress Summary

## Task Overview
The overall task is to migrate user stories from GitHub issues labeled with specific domains into corresponding CSV files located in the `docs/requirements/core/`, `docs/requirements/integrations/`, and `docs/requirements/ui/` directories. This involves fetching issue data, extracting relevant information based on Markdown headers and labels, formatting it as a CSV row, and appending it to the correct domain-specific CSV file while avoiding duplicates.

## Scope Boundaries
What IS included:
- Migrating GitHub issues with `domain:` labels to their corresponding CSV files.
- Extracting User Story, Priority, Estimated Complexity, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Requirements, Implementation Considerations, Related Issues/Stories, Related Documentation, and GitHub Issue Link from issue bodies and labels.
- Appending new, non-duplicate rows to existing CSV files.
- Processing issues for domains with existing CSV files in the `docs/requirements/` subdirectories.

What is NOT included:
- Modifying existing content within the CSV files.
- Creating new CSV files for domains that do not currently have one.
- Migrating issues without a clear `domain:` label.
- Implementing the features described in the user stories.
- Any tasks outside the scope of migrating existing GitHub issue data to CSV format.

## Current Status
- The migration process for the "Character System" domain is complete.
- The migration process for the "Player Decision System" domain was previously completed.
- Other core, integration, and UI domains with existing CSV files are pending migration.

## Completed Steps
1. Read the existing `docs/requirements/core/character-system-user-stories.csv` file to identify existing entries.
2. Searched GitHub for issues labeled `domain:character-system` in the `jerseycheese/Narraitor` repository.
3. Processed the retrieved issues, extracting relevant data and checking for duplicates against the existing CSV content.
4. Appended new, non-duplicate issues to `docs/requirements/core/character-system-user-stories.csv`.

## Next Steps
1. Select the next domain from the remaining list (Decision Relevance System, Devtools, Inventory System, Journal System, Lore Management System, Narrative Engine, State Management, Utilities and Helpers, World Configuration, AI Service, Character Interface, Game Session, Journal Interface, World Interface).
2. Read the corresponding CSV file for the selected domain.
3. Search GitHub for issues with the matching `domain:` label.
4. Process the issues, extract data, check for duplicates, and append new entries to the CSV.
5. Repeat for all remaining domains.

## TDD & KISS Status
- Tests written first: No (This task is a data migration/processing task, not feature implementation).
- Component size compliance: N/A (No new code components are being written).
- Storybook stories status: N/A (No UI components are being developed).
- Utilities leveraged: GitHub API (via MCP tool), File system operations (read, insert).

## Technical Context
- Utilizing the `@modelcontextprotocol-server-github` MCP server to interact with the GitHub API for searching and retrieving issue data.
- Parsing issue body content based on Markdown headers to extract structured information.
- Formatting extracted data into a comma-separated value (CSV) string, handling potential special characters and line breaks within fields.
- Using the `insert_content` tool to append new rows to CSV files, specifically targeting line 0 for appending to the end.
- Implementing a check for duplicate entries based on the GitHub issue URL to ensure idempotency.

## Pending Decisions
- The order in which to process the remaining domains.
