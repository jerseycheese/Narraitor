### State Management
The game session will use a combination of React Context and Redux for state management:
- Context: For UI-specific state like panel visibility, loading indicators
- Redux: For game state persistence, narrative history, and session management

### Responsiveness Strategy
- Mobile-first design approach
- CSS Grid layout for main components
- Flexbox for internal component layouts
- Media queries for breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px
- Collapsible panels on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Simplified layout on smaller screens

### Accessibility Implementation
- ARIA landmarks for main regions
- Focus trapping during modal dialogs
- Skip links for keyboard navigation
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast testing with WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard event handlers for all interactive elements
- Screen reader testing during development
