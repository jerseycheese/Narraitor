# Game Session Interface Requirements

## Overview
The Game Session Interface is the primary user-facing component for playing Narraitor. It displays the narrative content, presents choices to the player, shows relevant character information, and provides access to the journal. This interface is the core gameplay experience and must be intuitive, responsive, and immersive.

## Core Functionality

- **Choice Presentation**: Display choices for player decision-making
- **Character Information**: Show relevant character details
- **Journal Access**: Provide quick access to the journal
- **Input Handling**: Process player choices and custom inputs
- **Loading States**: Indicate when AI is generating content
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages
- **Session Controls**: Save, load, and exit game sessions
- **Game Recovery**: Recover from unexpected errors or crashes
- **Session Information**: Display current location, progress, and state
- **Context Awareness**: Show relevant information based on context (post-MVP)
- **Theming**: Apply world-appropriate visual styling
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the interface is usable by all players
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen sizes and devices
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth gameplay experience

## UI Components

### Core Components
- **NarrativeDisplay**: Shows the narrative content with appropriate formatting

### State Management
The game session will use a combination of React Context and Redux for state management:
- Context: For UI-specific state like panel visibility, loading indicators
- Redux: For game state persistence, narrative history, and session management

### Responsiveness Strategy
- Mobile-first design approach
- CSS Grid layout for main components
- Flexbox for internal component layouts
- Media queries for breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px
- Collapsible panels on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Simplified layout on smaller screens

### Accessibility Implementation
- ARIA landmarks for main regions
- Focus trapping during modal dialogs
- Skip links for keyboard navigation
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast testing with WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard event handlers for all interactive elements
- Screen reader testing during development
