# Game Session Interface Requirements

## Overview
The Game Session Interface is the primary user-facing component for playing Narraitor. It displays the narrative content, presents choices to the player, shows relevant character information, and provides access to the journal. This interface is the core gameplay experience and must be intuitive, responsive, and immersive.

## Core Functionality
- **Narrative Display**: Show AI-generated narrative content
- **Choice Presentation**: Display choices for player decision-making
- **Character Information**: Show relevant character details
- **Journal Access**: Provide quick access to the journal
- **Input Handling**: Process player choices and custom inputs
- **Loading States**: Indicate when AI is generating content
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages
- **Session Controls**: Save, load, and exit game sessions
- **Game Recovery**: Recover from unexpected errors or crashes
- **Session Information**: Display current location, progress, and state
- **Context Awareness**: Show relevant information based on context (post-MVP)
- **Theming**: Apply world-appropriate visual styling
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the interface is usable by all players
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen sizes and devices
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth gameplay experience

## UI Components

### Core Components
- **NarrativeDisplay**: Shows the narrative content with appropriate formatting
- **ChoiceSelector**: Presents player choices as buttons or cards
- **CharacterSummary**: Shows condensed character information
- **JournalButton**: Quick access to open the journal
- **LoadingIndicator**: Animated indicator for AI processing
- **ErrorDisplay**: User-friendly error messages
- **SessionControls**: Buttons for session management

- **RecoveryOptions**: Interface for recovering from errors
- **LocationIndicator**: Shows current narrative location
- **SaveIndicator**: Shows save status and history
- **ThemeProvider**: Applies world-specific styling
- **DebugControls**: Development tools for testing (dev mode only)
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Tracks and optimizes performance (dev mode only)

## User Interactions
- Users read narrative content that scrolls automatically
- Users select from provided choices to advance the narrative
- Users view their character's key information during play
- Users access the journal to review past events
- Users receive visual feedback during AI processing
- Users save their progress manually if desired
- Users exit the game session with proper state saving
- Users recover from unexpected errors or crashes
- Users view their current location and context
- Users receive feedback on game state changes
- Users can retry failed operations
- Users experience consistent performance across devices
- Users navigate the interface via mouse, keyboard, or touch

## Integration Points
- **Narrative Engine**: Receives and displays narrative content
- **Character System**: Shows relevant character information
- **Journal System**: Provides access to the journal
- **State Management**: Handles saving and loading state
- **AI Service**: Indicates loading states during AI calls
- **World System**: Applies appropriate theming and styling
- **Location System**: Shows current narrative location
- **Inventory System**: Provides access to character inventory (post-MVP)
- **Error Recovery**: Handles session recovery from failures

### State Management
The game session will use a combination of React Context and Redux for state management:
- Context: For UI-specific state like panel visibility, loading indicators
- Redux: For game state persistence, narrative history, and session management

### Responsiveness Strategy
- Mobile-first design approach
- CSS Grid layout for main components
- Flexbox for internal component layouts
- Media queries for breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px
- Collapsible panels on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Simplified layout on smaller screens

### Accessibility Implementation
- ARIA landmarks for main regions
- Focus trapping during modal dialogs
- Skip links for keyboard navigation
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast testing with WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard event handlers for all interactive elements
- Screen reader testing during development
