# Journal Interface Requirements

### State Management
The journal interface will use React Context for local state management:
- Tracking the currently selected entry
- Maintaining scroll position in the entry list
- Persisting view state during navigation

### Styling Approach
- Styled components with theme prop for world-specific styling
- CSS variables for theme colors, fonts, and spacing
- Simple animations for transitions between views
- Consistent typography based on the world theme

### Responsiveness Strategy
- Mobile-first design for the entry list and detail views
- Stacked layout on small screens, side-by-side on larger screens
- Touch-friendly tap targets for mobile users
- Appropriate font sizes across device sizes
- Breakpoints at 640px, 768px, and 1024px
