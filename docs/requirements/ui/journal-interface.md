# Journal Interface Requirements

## Overview
The Journal Interface provides a way for players to review their game history, including narrative events, important decisions, and character interactions. It serves as both a gameplay aid and a record of the player's unique story.

## Core Functionality

- **Entry Viewing**: Read detailed entry content
- **Entry Filtering**: Filter entries by type or other criteria (post-MVP)
- **Chronological Organization**: Timeline-based display of entries
- **Entry Navigation**: Move between related entries
- **Journal Persistence**: Access entries across multiple sessions
- **Entry Formatting**: Display entries with appropriate styling

## UI Components

- **EntryList**: Chronological list of journal entries
- **EntryDetail**: Detailed view of selected entry content
- **EntryTypeFilter**: Controls for filtering by entry type (post-MVP)
- **JournalHeader**: Title and controls for the journal
- **EntryCard**: Summary card for entries in the list
- **BackButton**: Return to game or navigate back
- **EmptyState**: Display when no entries match criteria

## User Interactions

### State Management
The journal interface will use React Context for local state management:
- Tracking the currently selected entry
- Maintaining scroll position in the entry list
- Persisting view state during navigation

### Styling Approach
- Styled components with theme prop for world-specific styling
- CSS variables for theme colors, fonts, and spacing
- Simple animations for transitions between views
- Consistent typography based on the world theme

### Responsiveness Strategy
- Mobile-first design for the entry list and detail views
- Stacked layout on small screens, side-by-side on larger screens
- Touch-friendly tap targets for mobile users
- Appropriate font sizes across device sizes
- Breakpoints at 640px, 768px, and 1024px
