### Form Validation Strategy
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for data integrity
- Inline validation messages next to form fields
- Form-level validation for cross-field dependencies
- Clear visual indicators for validation state
- Helpful error messages with suggestions for correction

### State Management
- React Context for wizard step state
- Form state using React Hook Form
- Redux for world data persistence
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Debounced auto-save during form editing

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Single-column layout on mobile devices
- Multi-column layout on larger screens
- Collapsible sections on smaller viewports
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile users
- Maintained usability across device sizes
