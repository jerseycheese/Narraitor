# Refined Requirements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refined requirements for the Narraitor MVP. The requirements have been updated to provide clearer scope boundaries, more specific implementation details, and well-defined user stories that can be directly converted to GitHub issues.

## Key Refinements Made

### World Configuration System
- Defined specific limits: up to 6 attributes (range 1-10) and 12 skills (range 1-5) per world
- Specified three template worlds: Fantasy Adventure, Sci-Fi Exploration, and Mystery Investigation
- Detailed the 4-step world creation wizard process
- Clarified tone settings options for narrative style, pacing, content rating, and language style
- Specified five pre-defined theme options for world styling

### Character System
- Detailed the 4-step character creation wizard: Basic Info, Attributes, Skills, and Background
- Established point-buy attribute allocation system with world-defined constraints
- Limited skill selection to a maximum of 8 skills per character
- Specified character filtering and sorting capabilities
- Defined text-based character description fields without portrait generation

### Narrative Engine
- Established player choice system with 3-4 options per decision point
- Defined context management preserving 5-10 narrative segments
- Specified scene transition handling with location/setting changes
- Detailed error recovery mechanisms with retries and fallback content
- Added prompt optimization for token efficiency

### Journal System
- Defined four primary entry types: narrative events, decisions, discoveries, and character encounters
- Added entry categorization by significance (major/minor)
- Included new/unread entry indicators and session date grouping
- Specified chronological list view with entry detail display
- Added filtering by entry type and significance

### State Management
- Detailed React Context + useReducer pattern implementation
- Specified IndexedDB persistence with auto-save every 5 minutes and after major events
- Added campaign management functionality (create, list, load, delete)
- Included export/import capabilities for campaigns and world configurations
- Defined error handling with storage failure detection and recovery

### Game Session UI
- Specified responsive narrative display with markdown formatting
- Detailed choice presentation as cards or buttons
- Added character summary panel showing relevant attributes and skills
- Included journal access button with unread indicator
- Specified loading states and world-appropriate styling

### AI Service Integration
- Focused on Google Gemini integration as primary AI provider
- Detailed prompt template system for different use cases
- Added retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Specified context optimization for token efficiency
- Included fallback content for service failures

## Implementation Phases

1. **Project Setup and Infrastructure** (1 week)
2. **World Configuration System** (1 week)
3. **Character System** (1 week)
4. **AI Service Integration** (1 week)
5. **Narrative Engine** (2 weeks)
6. **Journal System** (1 week)
7. **Game Session Integration** (1 week)
8. **Testing and Refinement** (1 week)

## Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Issues from Requirements
- Use the [Requirements to GitHub Issues Workflow](/docs/workflows/requirements-to-github.md) to convert requirements to GitHub issues
- Follow the [User Story Template](/docs/workflows/user-story-template.md) for consistent formatting
- Refer to [example issues](/docs/examples/github-issue-examples/) for guidance
- Organize issues in the project board by implementation phase

### 2. Set Up Core Project Structure
- Initialize Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript
- Configure development tools (ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Storybook)
- Create domain-driven folder structure
- Set up state management architecture
- Implement basic UI component library

### 3. Begin Phase 1 Implementation
- Start with World Configuration System
- Implement core data models and state management
- Create basic UI components for world creation
- Set up persistence layer with IndexedDB
- Develop template world system

## Scope Guidance

### Included in MVP
- Feature-complete but minimal implementation of all core systems
- Basic UI with responsive design and world-appropriate styling
- Google Gemini integration for narrative generation
- Local persistence using IndexedDB
- Essential user journeys for creating worlds, characters, and playing narratives
- Journal system for tracking game history
- Campaign management for multiple games

### Excluded from MVP
- Advanced visualization features (maps, character portraits)
- Combat systems
- Inventory management
- Multi-player functionality
- Voice narration or environmental sound effects
- Chat-like alternative input mode
- Advanced world customization beyond basic templates
- Character advancement and progression
- Complex branching narrative structures
- Advanced character relationship tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

The MVP will be considered complete when:
1. All core systems are implemented and functional
2. Essential user journeys can be completed end-to-end
3. The application persists state reliably between sessions
4. The UI is responsive and accessible
5. The AI integration generates appropriate narrative content
6. The codebase follows established best practices
7. Test coverage meets defined standards
8. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Risk Management

Key risks to monitor:
1. AI integration challenges with Google Gemini
2. Scope creep beyond defined MVP boundaries
3. IndexedDB implementation complexity
4. Performance issues with large datasets
5. Technical debt from implementation shortcuts

## Conclusion

The refined requirements provide a clear, focused scope for the Narraitor MVP. By strictly adhering to these boundaries while implementing the key features of each core system, we can deliver a functional narrative RPG framework within the 10-week timeline. The next step is to convert these requirements into specific GitHub issues to begin implementation.
