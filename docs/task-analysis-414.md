TASK ANALYSIS
GitHub Issue: #414 Document portrait generation system
Labels: documentation, domain:character-system
Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the character portrait generation feature including API endpoints, architecture, and integration guides.
Priority: Medium (Recent feature implementation that lacks documentation)
Current State: Portrait generation is implemented and working (with occasional API errors) but has no documentation.

TECHNICAL DESIGN
Data Flow:
- UI requests portrait → API endpoint `/api/generate-portrait`
- API constructs prompt from character data → Gemini API
- Gemini generates portrait → Base64 image returned
- Image stored in character state → Displayed in UI

Core Changes:
1. Documentation Structure
   - Location: `/docs/features/portrait-generation/`
   - Details: Create comprehensive documentation package
   
2. API Documentation
   - Location: `/docs/features/portrait-generation/api.md`
   - Details: Document endpoint, request/response formats, error codes
   
3. Architecture Documentation
   - Location: `/docs/features/portrait-generation/architecture.md`
   - Details: System design, components, data flow diagrams

4. Integration Guide
   - Location: `/docs/features/portrait-generation/integration-guide.md`
   - Details: How to use portrait generation in new components

INTERFACES
```typescript
// Existing interfaces to document
interface PortraitData {
  type: 'ai-generated' | 'placeholder' | 'uploaded' | 'preset';
  url: string | null;
  generatedAt?: string;
  prompt?: string;
}

interface PortraitGenerationRequest {
  character: Character;
  worldTheme?: string;
  customDescription?: string;
}

interface PortraitGenerationResponse {
  success: boolean;
  portrait?: PortraitData;
  error?: string;
}
```

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1. [ ] Analyze existing portrait generation implementation
2. [ ] Create documentation structure and README
3. [ ] Document API endpoint with OpenAPI/Swagger format
4. [ ] Create architecture diagrams using Mermaid
5. [ ] Write integration guide with code examples
6. [ ] Document prompt engineering approach
7. [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
8. [ ] Update main project README with links

Existing Utilities to Leverage:
- `/src/lib/ai/portraitGenerator.ts`: Core portrait generation logic
- `/src/app/api/generate-portrait/route.ts`: API endpoint implementation
- `/src/components/CharacterPortrait/`: UI component for display
- `/src/lib/ai/geminiClient.ts`: AI client integration

Files to Modify:
- `/README.md`: Add link to portrait documentation
Files to Create:
- `/docs/features/portrait-generation/README.md`: Overview and index
- `/docs/features/portrait-generation/api.md`: API documentation
- `/docs/features/portrait-generation/architecture.md`: System design
- `/docs/features/portrait-generation/integration-guide.md`: Usage guide
- `/docs/features/portrait-generation/prompt-engineering.md`: Prompt details
- `/docs/features/portrait-generation/troubleshooting.md`: Common issues

TEST PLAN
1. Documentation Verification:
   - All code examples compile and run
   - API documentation matches implementation
   - Diagrams accurately represent system
2. Integration Testing:
   - Follow integration guide to add portrait to new component
   - Verify troubleshooting steps resolve common issues

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Complete documentation package created
- [ ] API documented in OpenAPI format
- [ ] Architecture diagrams created
- [ ] Integration guide includes working examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers known issues (#406)
- [ ] Documentation linked from main README

TECHNICAL NOTES
- Portrait generation uses Google Gemini API for image generation
- System has fallback to placeholder portraits on failure
- Known character detection includes movies, TV, games, books
- Physical description field is critical for portrait accuracy
- Base64 encoding used for image storage in IndexedDB

OUT OF SCOPE
- Fixing API error issues (#406)
- Implementing image upload (#404)
- Creating preset avatar library (#405)
- Modifying existing implementation
- Performance optimization

FUTURE TASKS
- [ ] Fix API 500 errors (#406)
- [ ] Add custom image upload (#404)
- [ ] Create preset avatar library (#405)
- [ ] Migrate to external image storage
