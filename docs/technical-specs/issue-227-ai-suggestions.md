# Technical Specification for Issue #227

## Issue Summary
- Title: Generate AI suggestions for enhanced player experience
- Description: Uses AI to automatically suggest appropriate character abilities and traits based on the world description
- Labels: user-story, domain:world-configuration, priority:high, complexity:large
- Priority: High (MVP)

## Scope Boundaries
What IS included:
- AI analysis of world descriptions
- Generation of contextually relevant attribute suggestions
- Generation of appropriate skill suggestions based on world context
- Clear feedback during AI processing
- Names and descriptions for suggested attributes/skills

What is NOT included:
- Complete character generation
- Integration with game session
- Automatic application of suggestions without user approval
- Modification of existing worlds
- Complex customization of suggestion parameters

## Problem Statement
Users creating new worlds need guidance on appropriate attributes and skills that match their world vision. Without AI assistance, users must design all attributes and skills from scratch, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming. The system should leverage AI to analyze world descriptions and suggest contextually appropriate attributes and skills with names and descriptions.

## Technical Approach
1. Integrate with existing AI Service (geminiClient) to analyze world descriptions
2. Create a dedicated suggestion generation module within the worldAnalyzer
3. Enhance World Creation Wizard to display AI suggestions during attribute/skill setup
4. Implement clear loading states and error handling for AI operations
5. Structure AI prompts to generate specific attribute and skill suggestions with names and descriptions

## Implementation Plan
1. Enhance AI Service worldAnalyzer with suggestion generation methods
2. Add AI suggestion UI components to World Creation Wizard
3. Implement loading states and error handling for AI operations
4. Create comprehensive tests for AI suggestion flow
5. Add type definitions for AI suggestion responses
6. Update wizard flow to incorporate AI suggestions at appropriate steps

## Test Plan
Focus on key acceptance criteria with targeted tests:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Core functionality test: AI suggestion generation from world description
   - Error handling: graceful failure when AI service is unavailable
2. Component Tests:
   - Render test: suggestion display in wizard
   - User interaction test: accepting/rejecting AI suggestions
   - Loading state test: feedback during AI processing

## Files to Modify
- `/src/lib/ai/worldAnalyzer.ts`: Add suggestion generation methods
- `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/steps/AttributeReviewStep.tsx`: Display AI attribute suggestions
- `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/steps/SkillReviewStep.tsx`: Display AI skill suggestions
- `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/WorldCreationWizard.tsx`: Add AI suggestion state and loading management
- `/src/state/worldStore.ts`: Add temporary storage for AI suggestions

## Files to Create
- `/src/lib/ai/__tests__/worldAnalyzer.suggestions.test.ts`: Tests for AI suggestion generation
- `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/AISuggestions.tsx`: Component for displaying AI suggestions
- `/src/components/WorldCreationWizard/__tests__/AISuggestions.test.tsx`: Tests for AI suggestion component
- `/src/types/ai-suggestions.types.ts`: Type definitions for AI suggestions

## Existing Utilities to Leverage
- `/src/lib/ai/geminiClient.ts`: Existing AI client for API calls
- `/src/lib/ai/worldAnalyzer.ts`: Existing world analysis functionality
- `/src/lib/ai/responseFormatter.ts`: Response formatting utilities
- `/src/lib/ai/userFriendlyErrors.ts`: Error handling for AI operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] AI successfully analyzes world descriptions
- [ ] Relevant attribute suggestions are generated based on context
- [ ] Appropriate skill suggestions are generated based on context
- [ ] Clear loading feedback during AI processing
- [ ] User can accept or reject AI suggestions
- [ ] Names and descriptions are contextually relevant

## Out of Scope
- Modifying existing worlds with AI suggestions
- Character-specific AI suggestions
- Complex customization of suggestion parameters
- Deep learning from user feedback
- Real-time suggestion refinement
