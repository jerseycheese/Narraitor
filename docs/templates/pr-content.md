# Pull Request Template

## Description
This PR implements an AI-powered narrative generation system that dynamically creates engaging story content based on the world's theme, game context, and player choices. The implementation includes a flexible NarrativeGenerator service, template-based prompt system, and React components for displaying and managing narrative content with proper error handling and state management.

- [x] Test coverage maintained or improved

## User Stories Addressed
- Narrative generation system that adapts to world themes
- Dynamic narrative content based on player choices
- Persistent story segments with proper state management
- Error handling for narrative generation issues

## Flow Diagrams
N/A

## Component Development
- [x] Storybook stories created/updated
- [x] Components developed in isolation first
- [x] Visual consistency verified

The NarrativeDisplay and NarrativeController components were developed in Storybook first to ensure proper rendering and behavior in isolation before integration into the game session flow.

## Implementation Notes
1. **World-Specific Content**: The system adapts narrative content based on the world's theme, providing appropriate locations and tone for different genres (Fantasy, Western, Sci-Fi, etc.)

2. **Deduplication System**: Implemented safeguards to prevent duplicate narrative generation, including initial scene tracking and choice-based generation tracking to ensure narrative consistency.

3. **JSON Parsing**: Added robust JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms to handle different AI response formats, ensuring reliable content extraction even when responses contain unexpected formatting.

4. **Component Lifecycle**: Careful management of React component lifecycle to prevent state updates after unmounting and avoid memory leaks.

5. **Template System**: Uses a template-based approach for different narrative needs (initial scenes, standard scenes, transitions).

## Testing Instructions
1. **Storybook Testing**:
   - Run `npm run storybook`
   - Navigate to the Narrative section
   - Test NarrativeDisplay with different segment types
   - Verify NarrativeController with sample data

2. **Test Harness**:
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to `/dev/narrative-system`
   - Test generation for different world themes
   - Test different player choices and narrative continuity
   - Verify error handling by testing edge cases
   - Create new sessions to test initialization

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the narrative system within a complete game session
   - Verify narrative content adapts to world theme
   - Check player choices trigger appropriate narrative responses
