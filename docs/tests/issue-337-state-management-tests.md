# Test Specification for Issue #337: State Management

This document outlines the test strategy and structure for implementing state management related to Issue #337, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## Test File Structure

All test files for state management will reside under the `src/state/__tests__/` directory. Each domain store will have its own dedicated test file.

```
src/
└── state/
    └── __tests__/
        ├── aiContextStore.test.ts
        ├── characterStore.test.ts
        ├── inventoryStore.test.ts
        ├── journalStore.test.ts
        ├── narrativeStore.test.ts
        ├── sessionStore.test.ts
        └── worldStore.test.ts
```

## Test Cases Mapping to Acceptance Criteria

Test cases will be written to cover the following acceptance criteria for each store:

1.  **Store Definitions:** Verify that the store is correctly defined and accessible.
2.  **Default State Initialization:** Ensure that the store initializes with the correct default state.
3.  **Basic Actions:** Test the core actions (mutations/setters) to ensure they modify the state as expected.
4.  **Persistence Logic:** (If applicable) Test the logic for saving and loading state, ensuring data integrity.
5.  **Selectors:** Verify that selectors correctly derive and return state data.
6.  **Unit Tests Coverage:** Aim for high unit test coverage for all state logic.

## Data-testid Naming

Data-testid attributes are not applicable for pure state management logic as there are no UI components involved in these tests.

## Storybook Stories

Storybook stories are not within the scope of this testing effort, as the state management implementation for Issue #337 focuses solely on the core state logic without associated UI components.

## Explanation of TDD Approach

Test-Driven Development (TDD) will be followed for implementing the state management. This involves:

1.  Writing a test case for a specific piece of functionality (e.g., initializing default state, a specific action).
2.  Running the test and confirming that it fails (as the functionality is not yet implemented).
3.  Writing the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass.
4.  Refactoring the code while ensuring all tests continue to pass.
5.  Repeating the cycle for the next piece of functionality.

This approach ensures that code is only written to fulfill defined requirements and that a comprehensive test suite is built alongside the implementation.

## Verification List

**Covered by Unit Tests:**

*   Store definitions
*   Default state initialization
*   Basic actions (mutations/setters)
*   Persistence logic (if applicable)
*   Selectors

**Out of Scope for Unit Tests (Issue #337 State Management):**

*   UI component interactions (covered by separate UI tests/Storybook)
*   Integration with external services (covered by integration tests)
*   End-to-end user flows (covered by e2e tests)
