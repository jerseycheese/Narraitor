# Issue #115: Character Creation - Verification Checklist

## Overview
This document provides manual verification steps for the Character Creation feature implemented in issue #115.

**Implementation Status: COMPLETE** ✅  
All acceptance criteria have been implemented. Ready for final testing and verification.

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have at least one world created in the system
2. Run `npm run build` to verify no TypeScript errors
3. Navigate to `/characters` or `/dev/character-creation` for testing

## Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ **Real-time validation**: Next button now enables/disables immediately when point allocation is correct
- ✅ **Dynamic slider constraints**: Attribute sliders cannot exceed available points (prevents negative remaining)
- ✅ **Enhanced UX**: Attribute names more prominent, better visual hierarchy, gray background containers
- ✅ **TypeScript compliance**: All linting errors resolved, build passes successfully
- ✅ **Shared wizard components**: Consistent styling with WorldCreationWizard

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### 1. ✅ Users can enter a name and description for their character
**Implementation:** BasicInfoStep with validation and auto-save
**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/worlds` and select a world (required first)
2. Navigate to `/characters` 
3. Click "Create Character" button (green button in top right)
4. You should be at `/characters/create` with the CharacterCreationWizard
5. **Critical Test**: Enter character name (test validation: < 3 chars, > 50 chars, duplicate names)
6. Enter character description
7. Verify validation messages appear for invalid inputs
8. **Test auto-save**: Refresh page and verify data is preserved

**Alternative test path:** Go directly to `/dev/character-creation` for testing without world setup

### 2. ✅ Users can allocate attribute points according to world constraints
**Implementation:** AttributesStep with dynamic constraints and real-time validation
**Test Steps:**
1. Click "Next" to go to Attributes step
2. Verify world attributes are displayed with correct min/max values
3. **Critical Test**: Allocate points using sliders - verify you CANNOT drag sliders beyond available points
4. **Critical Test**: Verify point pool updates in real-time (total, spent, remaining)
5. **Critical Test**: Spend exactly all points and verify Next button enables immediately
6. **Critical Test**: Try to proceed without spending all points (should show error)
7. **Visual Test**: Verify attribute names are prominent (large, bold text)
8. **Visual Test**: Verify current values displayed prominently in blue

### 3. ✅ Users can select and rate skills based on world definitions
**Implementation:** SkillsStep with selection limits and point pool management
**Test Steps:**
1. Click "Next" to go to Skills step
2. Select skills from available world skills (max 8)
3. Allocate skill levels using point pool
4. Verify point tracking works correctly
5. Try to select more than 8 skills (should be prevented)
6. Verify skill levels respect min/max constraints

### 4. ✅ Users can provide a background and personality description
**Implementation:** BackgroundStep with validation
**Test Steps:**
1. Click "Next" to go to Background step
2. Enter character history (test < 50 chars validation)
3. Enter personality (test < 20 chars validation)
4. Enter goals and motivations (optional)
5. Verify validation messages for short entries

### 5. ✅ The created character is saved and appears in the character list
**Implementation:** Character creation with store integration and navigation
**Test Steps:**
1. Click "Create Character" button
2. Verify redirect to character detail page
3. Navigate to `/characters`
4. Verify new character appears in the list
5. Verify all character data was saved correctly

## Definition of Done Verification

### ✅ Code implemented following TDD approach
**Status:** Complete - Full wizard implementation with validation, auto-save, and shared components

**Status:** Complete - This verification document and implementation notes

### ⚠️ Passes accessibility standards (if applicable)
**Status:** Needs Testing
**Test Steps:**
1. Test keyboard navigation through all form elements
2. Verify screen reader compatibility
3. Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
4. Test with browser accessibility tools

### ⚠️ Responsive on all target devices (if UI component)  
**Status:** Needs Testing
**Test Steps:**
1. Test on mobile (320px width)
2. Test on tablet (768px width) 
3. Test on desktop (1024px+ width)
4. Verify wizard layout adapts properly

### ⚠️ Code reviewed
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Action Required:** Request code review from team

### 🔄 Acceptance criteria verified
**Status:** In Progress - This testing phase

## Priority Testing Focus

### **CRITICAL - Must Test First:**
1. **Attribute allocation with new constraints**
   - Test that sliders cannot exceed available points
   - Verify Next button enables immediately when correct points allocated
   - Confirm visual improvements (prominent names, blue values)

2. **End-to-end character creation flow**
   - Complete full wizard in one session
   - Verify character appears in character list
   - Confirm all data saved correctly

### **HIGH - Test After Critical:**
1. **Auto-save functionality across steps**
2. **Validation messaging on all steps**
3. **Shared wizard styling consistency**

### **MEDIUM - Test When Time Permits:**
1. **Responsive behavior**
2. **Accessibility compliance**
3. **Error handling edge cases**
