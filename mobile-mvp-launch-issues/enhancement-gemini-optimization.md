## Plain Language Summary
Reduce the amount of data used by AI features to work better on mobile connections and save users' data plans.

## Current Feature
The current Gemini API integration sends full context with each request, which can use significant mobile data and cause delays on slower connections.

## Domain
- [ ] World Configuration
- [ ] Character System
- [ ] Decision Tracking System

## Enhancement Description
Implement smart context management to reduce API payload sizes:
- Compress context before sending
- Implement sliding window for conversation history
- Cache and reuse common prompts
- Batch multiple small requests
- Add data usage monitoring and warnings

## Reason for Enhancement
- Mobile data plans have limits and can be expensive
- Reduces latency on slower mobile connections
- Improves battery life by reducing network activity
- Better user experience in low-connectivity areas
- Helps meet app store requirements for efficient apps

## Possible Implementation
```typescript
// Context compression
const compressContext = (context: string): string => {
  // Remove redundant whitespace
  // Compress repeated patterns
  // Use reference IDs for common elements
}

// Sliding window
const getRelevantContext = (history: Message[], maxTokens: number) => {
  // Keep only recent relevant messages
  // Prioritize important context
}

// Request batching
const batchAPIRequests = (requests: APIRequest[]) => {
  // Combine multiple requests into one
  // Split responses appropriately
}
```

## Alternatives Considered
- Local LLM for simple responses (too resource intensive)
- Pre-generated response trees (loses dynamic nature)
- Aggressive caching only (doesn't solve initial data usage)

## Additional Context
Google Play and App Store both monitor apps for excessive data usage. This optimization would help with app store reviews and user retention. Consider adding user settings for "data saver mode" vs "full quality mode".
