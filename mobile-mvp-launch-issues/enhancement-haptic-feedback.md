## Plain Language Summary
Add subtle vibration feedback to button presses and important game events to make the mobile experience feel more responsive and engaging.

## Current Feature
The current UI provides only visual feedback for user interactions, which can feel less responsive on mobile devices compared to native apps.

## Enhancement Description
Implement haptic feedback using Capacitor's Haptics plugin:
- Light tap for button presses
- Medium impact for important choices
- Success pattern for achievements
- Warning pattern for critical decisions
- Notification feedback for new journal entries

## Reason for Enhancement
- Makes the app feel more native and polished
- Provides additional feedback channel for users
- Improves accessibility for visual impairments
- Enhances immersion in key story moments
- Differentiates from web experience

## Possible Implementation
```typescript
import { Haptics, ImpactStyle } from '@capacitor/haptics';

// Button press
const handleButtonPress = async () => {
  await Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Light });
  // ... rest of handler
};

// Important choice
const handleCriticalChoice = async () => {
  await Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Heavy });
  // ... rest of handler
};

// Custom patterns
const successPattern = async () => {
  await Haptics.vibrate({ duration: 50 });
  setTimeout(() => Haptics.vibrate({ duration: 100 }), 100);
};
```

## Alternatives Considered
- Sound effects only (not as subtle, can be annoying)
- Visual feedback only (current approach, less engaging)
- No additional feedback (misses opportunity for polish)

## Additional Context
Should include a settings toggle for users who prefer no haptic feedback. Consider battery impact - use sparingly for important interactions only. Not all devices support haptics, so this should enhance but not be required for gameplay.
