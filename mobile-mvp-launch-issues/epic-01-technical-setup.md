## Plain Language Summary
Set up the technical foundation to convert our Next.js web app into mobile apps for iOS and Android using Capacitor framework.

## Epic Description
This epic covers all technical setup required to transform Narraitor from a web application into native mobile apps. This includes configuring Next.js for static export, installing and setting up Capacitor, and establishing the build pipeline for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Domain
- [x] Other: Infrastructure/Mobile Development

## Goals
- Configure Next.js for static export mode compatible with mobile deployment
- Install and configure Capacitor for both iOS and Android platforms
- Set up development environment for mobile testing
- Establish automated build process for mobile apps
- Create initial mobile app shells that can be deployed to devices

## User Stories
- [ ] User Story 1: Configure Next.js for Static Export #1
- [ ] User Story 2: Install and Configure Capacitor Core #2
- [ ] User Story 3: Set Up iOS Development Environment #3
- [ ] User Story 4: Set Up Android Development Environment #4
- [ ] User Story 5: Configure Mobile-Specific API Routing #5
- [ ] User Story 6: Implement Mobile Build Pipeline #6

## Timeline
Week 1-2 of MVP launch (Target completion: 2 weeks from start)

## Definition of Done
- Next.js successfully exports static files
- Capacitor installed and configured for both platforms
- Can build and run app on iOS simulator/device
- Can build and run app on Android emulator/device
- Build process documented
- CI/CD pipeline configured for mobile builds

## Additional Context
This is the foundational phase for mobile deployment. All subsequent mobile features depend on this setup being completed successfully. Focus on getting a basic "Hello World" version running on both platforms before moving to feature implementation.
