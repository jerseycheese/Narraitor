## Plain Language Summary
Enable the game to work without internet connection by implementing local storage, content caching, and offline AI responses.

## Epic Description
This epic ensures Narraitor provides a seamless experience even without internet connectivity. We'll implement robust offline capabilities using IndexedDB for game state, service workers for content caching, and pre-cached AI responses. The system will sync progress when connection is restored.

## Domain
- [x] State Management
- [x] Narrative Engine
- [x] AI Service Integration

## Goals
- Implement IndexedDB fallback for mobile storage
- Cache 80% of story content locally
- Store 100-200 common AI responses offline
- Create background sync for progress updates
- Handle offline/online state transitions gracefully
- Optimize storage usage for mobile devices

## User Stories
- [ ] User Story 1: IndexedDB Mobile Integration #13
- [ ] User Story 2: Story Content Caching System #14
- [ ] User Story 3: Offline AI Response Cache #15
- [ ] User Story 4: Background Sync Implementation #16
- [ ] User Story 5: Offline State Management #17
- [ ] User Story 6: Storage Optimization Strategy #18

## Timeline
Week 3-5 of MVP launch (overlaps with feature implementation)

## Definition of Done
- Game fully playable without internet connection
- Progress saves locally and syncs when online
- AI responses feel natural even when offline
- Storage usage stays under 100MB
- Smooth transitions between offline/online states
- No data loss during connectivity changes

## Additional Context
Offline functionality is critical for mobile apps and a common reason for App Store rejections. This implementation must be robust and handle edge cases like mid-game connection loss, storage limitations, and data conflicts during sync.
