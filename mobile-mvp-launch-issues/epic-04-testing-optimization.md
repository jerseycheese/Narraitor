## Plain Language Summary
Thoroughly test the mobile app across different devices and optimize performance to ensure smooth gameplay and pass app store requirements.

## Epic Description
This epic covers comprehensive testing across iOS and Android devices, performance optimization, and preparation for app store review. We'll establish testing protocols, fix critical issues, optimize load times and memory usage, and ensure the app meets platform-specific requirements.

## Domain
- [x] Other: Infrastructure/Testing

## Goals
- Test on minimum 5 iOS devices and 5 Android devices
- Achieve <3 second cold start time
- Keep memory usage under 150MB
- Reach 60 FPS for UI interactions
- Set up beta testing programs
- Fix all critical bugs before submission
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## User Stories
- [ ] User Story 1: Mobile Device Testing Matrix #19
- [ ] User Story 2: Performance Profiling and Optimization #20
- [ ] User Story 3: Beta Testing Program Setup #21
- [ ] User Story 4: Critical Bug Fixes #22
- [ ] User Story 5: Accessibility Compliance #23
- [ ] User Story 6: Platform-Specific Optimizations #24

## Timeline
Week 5-7 of MVP launch (3 weeks duration)

## Definition of Done
- Tested on all target devices without crashes
- Performance metrics meet targets
- Beta testers provide positive feedback
- No P0/P1 bugs remaining
- Accessibility audit passed
- App store pre-check tools show no issues

## Additional Context
This phase is critical for app store approval. Both Apple and Google have strict performance and quality requirements. Focus on stability over features - a polished experience with fewer features is better than a buggy app with more features.
