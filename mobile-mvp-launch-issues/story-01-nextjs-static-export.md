## Plain Language Summary
Configure our Next.js application to export as static HTML/CSS/JS files that can be embedded in mobile apps.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to configure Next.js for static export so that the app can run in mobile WebView environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Next.js config updated with `output: 'export'`
- [ ] All dynamic routes converted to static generation
- [ ] Image optimization configured for static export
- [ ] API routes refactored to work with static export
- [ ] Build successfully generates `out` directory with static files
- [ ] No server-side dependencies remain in production build

## Technical Requirements
- Update `next.config.js` with static export configuration
- Add `trailingSlash: true` for proper mobile routing
- Configure `images: { unoptimized: true }` for static image handling
- Refactor any `getServerSideProps` to `getStaticProps`
- Update API routes to use environment-based URLs
- Ensure all paths use relative URLs for assets

## Implementation Considerations
- Some Next.js features like ISR and middleware won't work in static export
- API routes will need to be handled differently (proxy through Capacitor)
- Image optimization will be disabled, consider pre-optimizing images
- Dynamic routes need explicit path generation
