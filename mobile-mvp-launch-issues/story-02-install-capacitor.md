## Plain Language Summary
Install the Capacitor framework and configure it to work with our Next.js application for both iOS and Android platforms.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to install and configure Capacitor so that I can build native mobile apps from the web codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Capacitor Core and CLI installed as dependencies
- [ ] iOS and Android platforms added to project
- [ ] `capacitor.config.ts` properly configured with app details
- [ ] Basic Capacitor commands (`sync`, `open`) working
- [ ] WebView configured to load the static export
- [ ] App ID and name properly set for both platforms

## Technical Requirements
- Install `@capacitor/core` and `@capacitor/cli`
- Install `@capacitor/ios` and `@capacitor/android`
- Run `npx cap init` to create configuration
- Configure app ID (e.g., `com.narraitor.app`)
- Set proper server URL for development
- Add platforms with `npx cap add ios` and `npx cap add android`
- Configure TypeScript support for Capacitor

## Implementation Considerations
- App ID must be unique and follow reverse domain notation
- Consider using environment variables for different configurations
- Capacitor 5.x requires specific Node.js versions
- Some npm scripts may need adjustment for Capacitor workflow

- [ ] Unit tests cover all logic paths
- [ ] Component has Storybook stories (if UI component)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Passes accessibility standards (if applicable)
- [ ] Responsive on all target devices (if UI component)
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
