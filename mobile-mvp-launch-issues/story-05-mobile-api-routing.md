## Plain Language Summary
Set up proper API routing so that our AI features work correctly when the app is running on mobile devices, avoiding CORS issues and security problems.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to configure API routing for mobile so that Gemini API calls work through Capacitor's native HTTP plugin.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API calls work from mobile WebView without CORS errors
- [ ] API keys remain secure and never exposed in mobile app
- [ ] Environment detection correctly identifies mobile vs web
- [ ] Fallback to web fetch when running in browser
- [ ] Error handling for network failures
- [ ] Request timeout handling for slow mobile connections

## Technical Requirements
- Implement Capacitor HTTP plugin for native requests
- Create API service abstraction layer
- Configure environment-based API endpoints
- Set up proxy configuration for development
- Implement request/response interceptors
- Add mobile-specific headers
- Create timeout and retry logic

```typescript
// Example implementation
import { CapacitorHttp } from '@capacitor/core';

const apiClient = {
  post: async (url: string, data: any) => {
    if (Capacitor.isNativePlatform()) {
      return CapacitorHttp.post({
        url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE}${url}`,
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        data,
      });
    } else {
      return fetch(url, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(data),
      });
    }
  }
};
```

## Implementation Considerations
- Mobile WebViews have different CORS policies than browsers
- Some Android versions have issues with certain headers
- Need to handle both development and production environments
- Consider implementing request caching for repeated API calls
- Monitor API usage to avoid rate limits on mobile
