## Plain Language Summary
Implement a mobile-compatible storage system that saves game progress locally using IndexedDB with fallback options for different mobile browsers.

## User Story
As a player, I want my game progress to save locally so that I can play without internet connection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] IndexedDB implementation works on iOS Safari
- [ ] IndexedDB implementation works on Android Chrome
- [ ] Automatic fallback to WebSQL or localStorage if needed
- [ ] Game state saves every 30 seconds automatically
- [ ] Save indicator shows when saving/saved
- [ ] Can restore full game state after app restart
- [ ] Handles storage quota errors gracefully

## Technical Requirements
- Implement Capacitor Storage plugin as primary option
- Create IndexedDB service with mobile optimizations
- Implement storage adapter pattern for fallbacks
- Add save queue for offline changes
- Create migration system for storage updates
- Implement data compression for large saves
- Add storage usage monitoring

## Implementation Considerations
- iOS has strict storage quotas that may clear data
- Different WebView versions have different storage APIs
- Consider using Capacitor's native storage for critical data
- Need to handle storage pressure scenarios
- Migration strategy needed for web-to-mobile users
