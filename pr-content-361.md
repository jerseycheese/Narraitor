## Description
Refactored the GameSession component from 445 lines to 230 lines by splitting it into smaller, focused components following the Container/Presenter pattern. This improves code maintainability and follows the project's file size constraints (<300 lines per file).

## Related Issue
Closes #361

- [ ] Test addition or improvement

## TDD Compliance
- [x] Tests written before implementation

## User Stories Addressed
This PR addresses the technical debt requirement to refactor the GameSession component to meet file size constraints.

## Component Development
- [x] Storybook stories created/updated
- [x] Components developed in isolation first
- [x] Visual consistency verified

## Implementation Notes
Created the following focused components:
- **PlayerChoices**: Handles player choice selection UI with radio button semantics
- **SessionControls**: Manages pause/resume/end buttons with proper ARIA attributes
- **GameSessionLoading**: Displays loading state with customizable message
- **GameSessionError**: Shows error state using existing ErrorMessage component
- **GameSessionActive**: Renders active game session combining all sub-components
- **useGameSessionState**: Custom hook encapsulating all state management logic

All existing behavior has been preserved, including:
- Accessibility features (focus management, screen reader announcements)
- Error handling with retry functionality
- Session state management (pause/resume/end)
- Player choice selection
