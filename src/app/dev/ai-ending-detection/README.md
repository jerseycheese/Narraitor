# AI Ending Detection Test Harness

## Overview

This test harness provides a browser-based interface for manually testing the AI ending detection system. It allows developers to test different narrative scenarios and observe how the AI analyzes story progression for natural ending points.

## Location

- **Path**: `/dev/ai-ending-detection`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/dev/ai-ending-detection` (when dev server is running)

## Features

### Test Scenarios

The harness includes four pre-defined test scenarios designed to validate different aspects of AI ending detection:

1. **Conclusive Story** - A complete hero's journey that should trigger ending suggestions
2. **Ongoing Adventure** - An unresolved narrative that should NOT trigger endings
3. **Character Growth Complete** - A personal journey with emotional closure
4. **False Positive (Contains Ending Keywords)** - Tests AI's ability to ignore misleading keywords

### Interactive Testing

- **Scenario Selection**: Choose from predefined test scenarios
- **Manual Segment Addition**: Add narrative segments one by one
- **Real-time AI Analysis**: Watch AI analyze each segment for ending indicators
- **Activity Logging**: Detailed log of AI analysis requests and responses

### Test Data

Each scenario contains 5 carefully crafted narrative segments that:
- Build a coherent story progression
- Test specific ending detection patterns
- Validate AI understanding vs keyword matching
- Demonstrate different ending types and confidence levels

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Testing Flow

1. **Select a Scenario**: Click on one of the four test scenario buttons
2. **Add Segments**: Use "Add Next Segment" to progress through the story
3. **Watch for AI Suggestions**: Monitor the activity log and ending suggestion display
4. **Verify Behavior**: Confirm AI suggestions match expected outcomes
5. **Reset**: Use "Reset Test" to start over with a different scenario

### Expected Results

- **Conclusive Story**: Should suggest ending after segment 4-5
- **Ongoing Adventure**: Should NOT suggest ending at any point
- **Character Growth**: Should suggest ending when personal arc completes
- **False Positive**: Should NOT suggest ending despite containing ending keywords

### Activity Log Interpretation

The activity log shows detailed information about each AI analysis:

```
14:30:25: 📖 Starting scenario: Conclusive Story
14:30:26: 📝 Added segment 1: "The hero begins their journey to save the kingdom..."
14:30:27: 🔍 Analyzing segment 1 for ending indicators...
14:30:28: 🤖 Sending AI analysis request...
14:30:30: 🤖 AI response: CONTINUE STORY (confidence: high)
...
14:35:45: 🤖 AI SUGGESTED ENDING: story-complete - The central conflict has been resolved...
```

## Implementation Details

### Test Environment Setup

The harness automatically creates:
- A test world with appropriate configuration
- A test character with minimal but valid data
- A dedicated session for isolated testing

### AI Analysis Integration

The test harness replicates the exact AI ending detection logic used in the main application:

- Same prompt template as production code
- Identical confidence filtering (medium/high only)
- Same error handling for AI failures
- Consistent JSON parsing with markdown code block support

### State Management

- Uses the actual narrative store for segment management
- Maintains isolation between test sessions
- Supports multiple test runs without interference

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Verification Steps

1. **Test All Scenarios**: Run through each scenario completely
2. **Verify AI Independence**: Confirm "False Positive" scenario doesn't trigger despite keywords
3. **Check Confidence Filtering**: Observe that only medium/high confidence suggestions appear
4. **Validate Error Handling**: Test behavior when AI service is unavailable
5. **Confirm Context Requirements**: Verify no analysis occurs with fewer than 3 segments

### Common Issues and Solutions

**No AI Suggestions Appear**:
- Check that GEMINI_API_KEY is configured
- Verify internet connectivity for AI service calls
- Check browser console for error messages

**Unexpected Ending Suggestions**:
- Review the activity log for AI reasoning
- Consider if the narrative truly seems conclusive
- Check confidence level (only medium/high trigger suggestions)

**Test Scenarios Don't Load**:
- Refresh the page to reset component state
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify dev server is running correctly

## Code Structure

### Key Components

```typescript
// Main test interface
export default function AIEndingDetectionTestPage() {
  // Test scenario management
  const TEST_SCENARIOS = { /* ... */ };
  
  // AI detection simulation
  const checkEndingIndicators = async (existingSegments, newSegment) => {
    // Replicates NarrativeController logic exactly
  };
  
  // Test flow control
  const startScenario = async (scenarioKey) => { /* ... */ };
  const addNextSegment = async () => { /* ... */ };
  const resetTest = () => { /* ... */ };
}
```

### Integration Points

- **Narrative Store**: Uses `useNarrativeStore` for segment management
- **Character Store**: Uses `useCharacterStore` for test character creation
- **World Store**: Uses `useWorldStore` for test world creation
- **AI Client**: Uses `createDefaultGeminiClient` for AI analysis

## Development Notes

### Adding New Test Scenarios

To add new test scenarios:

1. Add scenario to `TEST_SCENARIOS` object
2. Provide 5 narrative segments that test specific ending patterns
3. Update expected results documentation
4. Test the new scenario thoroughly

### Modifying AI Analysis

The test harness AI logic should always match the production code in `NarrativeController.tsx`. When updating the main implementation:

1. Copy the exact `checkForEndingIndicators` logic
2. Ensure identical prompt templates
3. Maintain same error handling
4. Keep JSON parsing logic synchronized

### Performance Considerations

- Each AI analysis call may take 2-5 seconds
- Test harness includes request timing in activity logs
- UI remains responsive during AI analysis
- Multiple concurrent tests are supported
