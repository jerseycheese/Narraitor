# World Creation Wizard Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

1. **Component Structure**
   - Multi-step wizard with 5 steps: Basic Info, Description, Attributes, Skills, Finalize
   - Each step is a separate component with proper state management
   - Navigation between steps with Back/Next/Cancel buttons

2. **State Management**
   - WizardState interface tracking current step, world data, AI suggestions, errors
   - Proper state persistence when navigating between steps
   - Integration with worldStore for creating worlds

3. **Default Suggestions**
   - 6 default attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Charisma, Dexterity, Constitution
   - 12 default skills: Combat, Stealth, Perception, Persuasion, Investigation, Athletics, Medicine, Survival, Arcana, Deception, Intimidation, Performance
   - Each skill has a learning curve (easy/medium/hard) and linked attribute

4. **AI Integration**
   - WorldAnalyzer service that calls Gemini API
   - Fallback to defaults if AI fails
   - Loading state during AI processing

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for the full flow
   - Test harness for manual testing

## Issues Found During Testing

1. **Navigation Behavior**
   - The test harness was overriding navigation with alerts
   - Fixed by removing the custom handlers in test harness

2. **Hydration Warning**
   - Due to client-side only code executing on server
   - Fixed by properly checking for mounted state

3. **Storybook Display**
   - Stories weren't showing correct step
   - Fixed by creating wrapper component with proper state initialization

## Test URLs Available

- `/test-harness` - Basic test harness
- `/debug-wizard` - Debug info with defaults display
- `/wizard-demo` - Demo with logging
- `/simple-test` - Simplified implementation for testing

## Key Features Working

1. Cancel button navigates to `/worlds`
2. Complete button navigates to `/worlds`
3. 6 attributes and 12 skills are available by default
4. "Learning Curve" label is used instead of "Difficulty"
5. State persists when navigating between steps
6. AI suggestions work with fallback to defaults

## Remaining Considerations

1. The hydration warning might still appear due to browser extensions (Grammarly)
2. Component size is approaching 300 line limit and may need refactoring
3. Point pool system for attributes/skills is not implemented (marked as future feature)
4. Confirmation dialog for cancel is not implemented (marked as future feature)
