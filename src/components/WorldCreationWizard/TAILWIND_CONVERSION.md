# Removing Inline Styles from WorldCreationWizard

## Overview

As part of the Tailwind CSS v4 configuration fix (Issue #350), we've removed all inline styles from components and replaced them with minimal Tailwind CSS classes. This document provides information about the changes made.

> **Note:** This is part of a larger effort to standardize styling with Tailwind CSS v4. For the complete configuration guide, see [Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration](/docs/technical-guides/tailwind-css-v4-configuration.md).

## Completed Conversions

All components have been converted from inline styles to minimal Tailwind classes:

1. `WorldCreationWizard.tsx` - Main component with minimal Tailwind classes
2. `BasicInfoStep.tsx` - First step component with minimal Tailwind classes
3. `AttributeReviewStep.tsx` - Attribute review component with minimal Tailwind classes
4. `DescriptionStep.tsx` - Description step component with minimal Tailwind classes
5. `SkillReviewStep.tsx` - Skill review component with minimal Tailwind classes
6. `FinalizeStep.tsx` - Final step component with minimal Tailwind classes

## Conversion Approach

For each component:
1. All `style=` attributes have been removed
2. Minimal Tailwind classes have been added for basic layout and functionality
3. The large `styles` object at the bottom of each file has been removed
4. A simple `WizardClassNames.ts` utility has been created with basic class mappings for consistency

## Styling Guidelines

The current styling follows these principles:
1. **Minimal** - Only essential styling for layout and basic appearance
2. **Functional** - Prioritize function over form at this stage
3. **Consistent** - Use consistent patterns and spacing across components
4. **Maintainable** - Easy to understand and modify

## Future Enhancements

For future styling work:
1. Create a more comprehensive design system using Tailwind CSS
2. Add more responsive design elements
3. Improve interactive states (hover, focus, etc.)
4. Implement animations and transitions
5. Consider extracting common patterns to reusable components

## Testing

All components have been tested to ensure functionality is maintained.
