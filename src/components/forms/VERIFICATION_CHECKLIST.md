# Issue #290 Verification Checklist

This document contains a checklist for verifying the implementation of GitHub Issue #290: "Configure numeric ranges and defaults for character skills".

## Functionality Verification

### Core Requirements

- [x] Skills have a fixed range of 1-5 values
- [x] Each skill level has a descriptive label (Novice, Apprentice, etc.)
- [x] Users can set default values for skills within the defined range
- [x] Validation prevents values outside the allowed range
- [x] UI provides visual feedback for the current value

### Component-specific Checks

#### SkillRangeEditor

- [x] Displays the current value with its descriptive label
- [x] Updates value when slider is moved
- [x] Properly handles disabled state
- [x] Shows/hides labels based on showLabels prop
- [x] Shows/hides level descriptions based on showLevelDescriptions prop

#### WorldSkillsForm

- [x] New skills are created with proper default values
- [x] Uses constant for default difficulty level
- [x] Allows editing of skill name, description, category, and difficulty
- [x] Updates skill baseValue when range slider changes
- [x] Properly saves changes when form is submitted

#### SkillReviewStep

- [x] Shows skills with their range values
- [x] Allows toggling skill inclusion
- [x] Properly passes skills to next step
- [x] Includes skills by default

### Edge Cases

- [x] Handles legacy data with values outside the 1-5 range
- [x] Works correctly with empty skill lists
- [x] UI elements resize appropriately based on container width
- [x] Works in both light and dark themes
- [x] Keyboard accessibility for range slider controls

## Test Coverage

- [x] SkillRangeEditor component tests
- [x] WorldSkillsForm integration tests
- [x] SkillReviewStep tests
- [x] RangeSlider component tests
- [x] SkillDifficulty component tests
- [x] WorldCreationWizard flow tests

## Visual Verification

- [x] Storybook stories render correctly
- [x] Range slider styling matches design system
- [x] Difficulty badges have appropriate colors
- [x] Text is properly aligned and spaced
- [x] Mobile responsiveness

## Browser Compatibility

- [x] Works in Chrome
- [x] Works in Firefox
- [x] Works in Safari
- [x] Works in Edge

## Performance

- [x] No noticeable lag when moving slider
- [x] Renders efficiently without excessive re-renders
- [x] Transitions are smooth
- [x] No memory leaks (check React DevTools)

## Documentation

- [x] Component documentation (README files)
- [x] Implementation details document
- [x] Comments on complex code
- [x] Types are well-defined and documented
- [x] Constants have clear names and comments

## Final User Journey Test

1. [x] Create a new world
2. [x] Choose a template
3. [x] Progress to Skills Review step
4. [x] Change default values using range sliders
5. [x] Include/exclude skills
6. [x] Complete world creation
7. [x] Verify skills are saved with correct values

## Regression Testing

- [x] Check that attributes still work correctly
- [x] Verify world creation wizard still completes successfully
- [x] Ensure navigation between steps works as expected
